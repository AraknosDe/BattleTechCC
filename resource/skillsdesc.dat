Acrobatics;ACROBATICS<br>Subskills: Free-Fall, Gymnastics<br>The Acrobatics Skill covers the character’s grace, balance<br>and training to handle complex—and generally dangerous—<br>physical movement. Modifi ers to typical Acrobatics Skill Checks<br>should include weather and gravity conditions, character<br>encumbrance, terrain diffi culty and the distance the character<br>is moving. Acrobatics comes with two main subskills: Free-Fall<br>and Gymnastics.<br> Free-Fall: Covers all manner of jumping, gliding, unpowered<br>flight and the use of personal jump packs. A successful Acrobatics/<br>Free-Fall Check represents a safe landing. A failed check represents<br>a crash, with the severity of any damage based on the roll’s Margin<br>of Failure.<br> Gymnastics: Covers general feats of agility, balance and<br>grace. Though commonly used for show, Gymnastics also covers<br>a multitude of situations where the character may be trying to<br>move around complex obstacles, negotiate exceedingly difficult<br>terrain, avoid falls due to poor and unstable footing, or ecute<br>short jumps. A successful Acrobatics/Gymnastics Check can help<br>the character pass through diffi cult terrain better than others (in<br>personal combat, this can eff ectively reduce the character’s normal<br>movement costs per turn by 1 MP per point of MoS, to a minimum<br>of 1 MP per meter moved), or avoid damage from falls as high as<br>the Skill’s current level (in meters). A failed Acrobatics/Gymnastics<br>Check can range from a stumble that slows the character down, to<br>a potentially bone-breaking fall.
Acting;ACTING<br>Subskills: None<br> The Acting Skill covers the character’s ability to use language,<br>projection and personality to entertain, misdirect or just plain<br>charm the socks off someone. Typical Acting Skill Checks<br>should take into account conditions that could harm or help the<br>character’s performance (such as whether he lacks the proper<br>attire or props to present a convincing appearance). However, if<br>the subject is particularly skeptical or wary of the acting character,<br>an Opposed Action Check may be in order to properly resolve the<br>use of this Skill.<br> Acting has no subskills, though it can cover a range<br>of specialties covering deception (the art of lying), fast-<br>talk (bombarding a subject with enough superfluous<br>information to overwhelm him), intimidation (using body<br>language and strength of will to cow a subject with implied<br>threats and bluff s), performance (general entertainment<br>acting, including impersonations) and seduction (the art of<br>charming a subject). Characters seeking to emphasize one of<br>these aspects over another are advised to select one of those<br>Acting styles as a specialty.<br>The success (or failure) of an Acting Check determines<br>whether or not the Acting character delivered a credible<br>performance.
Administration;ADMINISTRATION<br>Subskills: None<br> The Administration Skill covers the character’s ability<br>to organize, allocate and track resources for a project—<br>preferably while keeping the entire operation on time and<br>under budget. As this Skill refl ects an abstract and generally<br>universal concept, applicable in business, industrial or<br>military logistics, it has no major subskills, but players may<br>consider an area of specialty to reflect a project type or<br>work sector that is more familiar to them (such as military<br>logistics, business administration, human resources, land<br>management and so forth).<br> Characters with Administration and who maintain a<br>landhold or a business interest, or are actively working in<br>the support chain of a military command, may use this Skill<br>in game play once a month, with the gamemaster assigning<br>modifiers to the standard Skill Check based on any applicable<br>conditions (such as time, budgetary or manpower limits, and<br>demands on the character). Characters with landholds or<br>business interests may use Administration to determine their<br>profit margins on a monthly basis (with a general increase of<br>5 percent per 2 points of MoS, or a loss of 5 percent per MoF<br>point). In all other fi elds, successful Administration Checks<br>may influence whether or not critical supplies, manpower or<br>salaries are received on time.
Animal Handling/Herding;ANIMAL HANDLING<br>Subskills: Herding, Riding, Training<br> The ability to control or infl uence animals, or to interpret<br>their behavior, is governed by the Animal Handling Skill.<br>Modifiers to typical Animal Handling Skill Checks should<br>include the physical and emotional state of the creature being<br>handled, the demeanor of the handler, and any distracting<br>circumstances such as loud noises or other physical stimulus.<br>Animal Handling comes with three main subskills: Herding,<br>Riding and Training. In addition, characters can have specialties<br>focused on a specific creature or class of creatures.<br> Herding: The Herding subskill is used by breeders and<br>ranchers across known space, and includes knowledge of<br>animal diets, life cycles, habitat, behavior and overall animal<br>husbandry. It includes a rudimentary understanding of the<br>animal’s health and its diseases (though it is still no substitute<br>for a veterinarian), but Skill Checks are typically required simply<br>to ensure that a population of animals under the handler’s<br>control is healthy, stable and otherwise well behaved.
Animal Handling/Riding;ANIMAL HANDLING<br>Subskills: Herding, Riding, Training<br> The ability to control or infl uence animals, or to interpret<br>their behavior, is governed by the Animal Handling Skill.<br>Modifiers to typical Animal Handling Skill Checks should<br>include the physical and emotional state of the creature being<br>handled, the demeanor of the handler, and any distracting<br>circumstances such as loud noises or other physical stimulus.<br>Animal Handling comes with three main subskills: Herding,<br>Riding and Training. In addition, characters can have specialties<br>focused on a specific creature or class of creatures.<br> Riding: The Riding subskill is used when mounting tamed<br>animals, and includes the ability to interpret the animal’s<br>behavior as well as the knowledge necessary to properly ride<br>the mount. Similar to Piloting or Driving, Animal Handling/<br>Riding mainly requires Skill Checks when attempting to<br>perform special tasks while mounted, such as avoiding a spill<br>when turning at full speed.
Animal Handling/Training;ANIMAL HANDLING<br>Subskills: Herding, Riding, Training<br> The ability to control or influence animals, or to interpret<br>their behavior, is governed by the Animal Handling Skill.<br>Modifiers to typical Animal Handling Skill Checks should<br>include the physical and emotional state of the creature being<br>handled, the demeanor of the handler, and any distracting<br>circumstances such as loud noises or other physical stimulus.<br>Animal Handling comes with three main subskills: Herding,<br>Riding and Training. In addition, characters can have specialties<br>focused on a specific creature or class of creatures.<br> Training: The Training subskill is used to tame and train an<br>animal for use as a mount. Checks for this Skill are typically<br>made at the end of a training session with the creature, with<br>success indicating that the animal has learned something and<br>failure indicating that the lessons didn’t stick.
Appraisal;APPRAISAL<br>Subskills: None<br>Appraisal is used to determine the relative value or<br>authenticity of an object, and includes suffi cient knowledge<br>of the appropriate market to derive or deduce its monetary<br>value. Appraisal is typically combined with a more academic<br>Interest Skill (see p. 147) and often cannot be obtained<br>without formal education or apprenticeship. Appraisal should<br>be used for objects that have a certain degree of subjective<br>value attached, such as art or historical artifacts, as the value<br>of such objects can be amplifi ed or depressed in a manner<br>separate from normal supply and demand mechanics. For<br>more practical objects—such as electronics, tools and other<br>mechanical or high-tech items—the appropriate Technician<br>Skill is a better choice for identifying value (see p. 157).
Archery;ARCHERY<br>Subskills: None<br>The Archery Skill covers the use of bows and arrows, archaic<br>ranged weapons that discharge a projectile using mechanical<br>force from a drawn bow and string. When wielding bows or<br>crossbows in personal combat, the Archery Skill is used to<br>make the attack.<br>Though the Archery Skill has no subskills, the diff erences<br>between hand-drawn bows and crossbows are significant<br>enough to merit specialization, if the player so desires.
Art;ART<br>Subskills: Various media (Dance, Drawing, Music, Painting,<br>Poetry, Sculpture, Songwriting, Writing and so on)<br> The Art Skill reflects an aesthetic talent the character has<br>cultivated purely as a means of creative expression. Born more<br>of creativity and handiwork than mere study and research, the<br>Art Skill refl ects a range of potential subskills from dancing and<br>music to painting and sculpture. Art Skill Checks are made at the<br>end of the character’s efforts to create (or perform) a work of art,<br>a process that can take hours, days or even years. Roll modifiers<br>should account for the complexity of the work being attempted,<br>the medium and supplies, and whether or not the artist rushed<br>the job. Success means the character executed the work well,<br>while failure indicates a work that, once completed, may not have<br>been worth the hype.<br> Tiered Skill: To refl ect the diff erence between a casual “hobby”<br>artist and a dedicated professional, Art is represented in A Time <br>of War as a Tiered Skill, progressing from simple training at the<br>lowest four levels (0 through 3) to a more advanced and focused<br>form from which true masterpieces can emerge.
Artillery;ARTILLERY<br>Subskills: None<br> The Artillery Skill is used to fire and spot for all kinds of artillery-<br>type weapons, from the single-impulse chemical-propelled<br>projectiles of “tube artillery” to self-propelled artillery missiles<br>like the Arrow IV system. Though used primarily on ’Mechs and<br>vehicles, artillery weapons can also be towed into battle by<br>infantry formations, and so are not considered a simple off shoot<br>of the Gunnery Skill. Indeed, certain infantry-carried Support<br>Weapons (such as mortars) also make use of this Skill.<br> Full rules on the use of artillery in tactical combat are found in<br>Tactical Operations, but additional rules applicable to A Time of<br>War are outlined in the combat chapters of this book.
Career;CAREER<br>Subskills: Various occupations (Examples: Accountant, Cook,<br>Doctor, Soldier and so on)<br> In order to be successful in a given profession, a wide range of<br>skills and knowledge is necessary. The Career Skill is a catch-all that<br>covers the jargon and procedures a character needs to perform<br>the general day-to-day duties of his job such as paperwork,<br>reports to supervisors and the like.<br>Career Skill Checks are used only to resolve tasks that fall within<br>the character’s chosen profession, but that are not adequately<br>represented by the other Skills in this chapter. If the character<br>possesses another Skill that better fi ts a part of his profession,<br>use that Skill instead (even if it is of a lower level). For example, a<br>MechWarrior with the Career/Soldier Skill at Level 3 cannot use it<br>in place of his Level 2 Gunnery/’Mech Skill.<br> The gamemaster must ultimately decide if a particular task in<br>
the character’s job can be resolved using the Career Skill, or must<br>be resolved with another Skill or Attribute Check.
Climbing;CLIMBING<br>Subskills: None<br> The Climbing Skill is necessary when attempting to scale up<br>or down any heights without the benefi t of stairs, ladders or<br>elevators. Though formal training isn’t required to climb relatively<br>simple objects like trees and rocks with a decent slope to them,<br>negotiating the steep rock face of a mountain, clambering up<br>the side of a building or swarming a moving BattleMech requires<br>more than a little practice.<br>Possession of the Climbing Skill allows the character to use<br>Climbing movement in personal combat as a Simple Action<br>(without it, Climbing is not only an untrained Skill, but a Complex<br>Action as well). In addition, this Skill covers knowledge of climbing<br>and rappelling gear.<br>Climbing Skill Checks (when required) may be modified<br>based on how treacherous or diffi cult to climb a surface is, how<br>much weight the character is carrying, and whether or not the<br>character is using any kind of climbing gear suitable for the job.<br>On a successful Climbing Check, a character scales the surface he<br>is climbing; on a failure, he falls. (Merciful gamemasters should<br>consider allowing a failed Climbing Check with a low MoF to<br>represent a momentary slip, on which the character merely loses<br>some distance.)
Communications/Black Box;COMMUNICATIONS<br>Subskills: Black Box, Conventional EM, Hyperpulse Generator<br> The Communications Skill is used for all methods of organized<br>communication. This Skill gives the character an understanding<br>of how to use local communications networks commonly<br>found on any inhabited world, as well as how to transmit and<br>receive data and messages over such networks. Action Checks<br>for this Skill are used most often to establish or tap into a<br>communications network, detect and receive incoming signals,<br>triangulate the source of an unidentifi ed comm signal, or even<br>attempt to jam enemy communications. Other actions related<br>to communications—such as translating coded messages,<br>hacking into automated systems or repairing damaged comm<br>equipment—all require other Skills (Cryptography, Computers<br>and Technician/Electronics, respectively).<br>Skill modifi ers for Communications can include bonuses for the<br>proper equipment (a character cannot use this Skill without some<br>form of communications equipment), and penalties for hostile (or<br>neutral) interference. In some cases, Opposed Communications<br>Checks may even be necessary to resolve an eff ort to overcome<br>an active enemy jamming eff ort.<br>Communications comes with three main subskills, each<br>reflecting a different method of communication used in the<br>thirty-first century: Black Box, Conventional EM and Hyperpulse<br>Generator.<br> Black Box: A top-secret interstellar communications device<br>(often also called a fax because it sends and receives messages<br>as simple text-on-paper), the so-called black box represents<br>a peculiar Star League-era experimental technology based<br>on older pre-HPG communications tech. Its transmissions are faster<br>than light, but slower and more restrictive than hyperpulse<br>technology.Because it remains classified among the few major<br>powers that have samples of this device, formal training in<br>Communications/Black Box is non-existent.
Communications/Conventional EM;COMMUNICATIONS<br>Subskills: Black Box, Conventional EM, Hyperpulse Generator<br> The Communications Skill is used for all methods of organized<br>communication. This Skill gives the character an understanding<br>of how to use local communications networks commonly<br>found on any inhabited world, as well as how to transmit and<br>receive data and messages over such networks. Action Checks<br>for this Skill are used most often to establish or tap into a<br>communications network, detect and receive incoming signals,<br>triangulate the source of an unidentified comm signal, or even<br>attempt to jam enemy communications. Other actions related<br>to communications—such as translating coded messages,<br>hacking into automated systems or repairing damaged comm<br>equipment—all require other Skills (Cryptography, Computers<br>and Technician/Electronics, respectively).<br>Skill modifiers for Communications can include bonuses for the<br>proper equipment (a character cannot use this Skill without some<br>form of communications equipment), and penalties for hostile (or<br>neutral) interference. In some cases, Opposed Communications<br>Checks may even be necessary to resolve an eff ort to overcome<br>an active enemy jamming eff ort.<br>Communications comes with three main subskills, each<br>reflecting a different method of communication used in the<br>thirty-first century: Black Box, Conventional EM and Hyperpulse<br>Generator.<br> Conventional EM: Conventional electromagnetic<br>communications—often referred to by the archaic term “radio”—<br>represents the most basic and accessible form of communications.<br>This subskill covers the use of wired and wireless communications<br>devices, from personal communicators and radios to satellite<br>relay systems and C3 networks, including LOS laser and<br>microwave communicators.
Communications/Hyperpulse Generator;COMMUNICATIONS<br>Subskills: Black Box, Conventional EM, Hyperpulse Generator<br> The Communications Skill is used for all methods of organized<br>communication. This Skill gives the character an understanding<br>of how to use local communications networks commonly<br>found on any inhabited world, as well as how to transmit and<br>receive data and messages over such networks. Action Checks<br>for this Skill are used most often to establish or tap into a<br>communications network, detect and receive incoming signals,<br>triangulate the source of an unidentified comm signal, or even<br>attempt to jam enemy communications. Other actions related<br>to communications—such as translating coded messages,<br>hacking into automated systems or repairing damaged comm<br>equipment—all require other Skills (Cryptography, Computers<br>and Technician/Electronics, respectively).<br>Skill modifiers for Communications can include bonuses for the<br>proper equipment (a character cannot use this Skill without some<br>form of communications equipment), and penalties for hostile (or<br>neutral) interference. In some cases, Opposed Communications<br>Checks may even be necessary to resolve an effort to overcome<br>an active enemy jamming effort.<br>Communications comes with three main subskills, each<br>reflecting a different method of communication used in the<br>thirty-first century: Black Box, Conventional EM and Hyperpulse<br>Generator.<br> Hyperpulse Generator: Ever since the heyday of the Star League,<br>virtually all interstellar communications have been handled<br>by the vast network of hyperpulse generators that link nearly<br>every inhabited world together. Essentially a massive energy<br>cannon, designed to “shoot” ultra-compressed signal batches<br>through hyperspace, the hyperpulse generator (HPG) is the most<br>efficient and secure form of interstellar communications known<br>to thirty-first century humankind, even as the stewards of its<br>technological secrets—ComStar and the Word of Blake—wage war<br>against one another. Only ComStar, Word of Blake and the Clans<br>train people in HPG communications, making this Skill only<br>somewhat easier to come by than Communications/Black Box.
Computers;COMPUTERS<br>Subskills: None<br>The Computers Skill covers the operation or creation of<br>software using computers in the BattleTech universe. While<br>the user interface of most devices is suffi cientl y simple<br>to operate that it takes no training or Skill to accomplish<br>rudimentary tasks, taking full advantage of a computer’s<br>capabilities to access data, conduct in-depth research or hack<br>into sensitive networks requires some form of the Computers<br>Skill. Action Checks for this Skill apply any time the<br>character attempts to do more than browse the system or use<br>ready-made applications (such as word processors, electronic<br>readers or accessing local GPS and interweb networks).<br> Modifiers may apply if the software is outdated, corrupted<br>or just plain incompatible with the system being used, or<br>if the system has been locked against potential hackers.<br> The Computers Skill has no subskills, but the tiered nature<br>of this Skill helps mark the diff erence between computer<br>operations and computer programming. Skilled computer<br>operators can take full advantage of the computer’s<br>capabilities, including the ability to quickly navigate the<br>memory and storage devices attached to the computer to find<br>hidden data, hard-to-reach network sites, and even diagnose<br>software and hardware problems. Programmers, meanwhile, can<br>create, alter and manipulate software, or even hack through<br>software security and fi rewalls to dig up ultra-sensitive<br>data.<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the diff erence between casual<br>computer operations and more sophisticated programming and<br>hacking, the Computers Skill is represented in A Time<br>of War as a Tiered Skill, progressing from simple computer<br>operations at the Basic four levels (0 through 3) to more<br>advanced programming levels where the user can create<br>and manipulate programs rather than simply running them,<br>and bypass virtual security.
Cryptography;CRYPTOGRAPHY<br>Subskills: None<br>The techniques and process of coding and decoding data is<br>known as cryptography. The Cryptography Skill enables a<br>character to attempt to create and decode communications and<br>data alike. When using this Skill to encode data, the<br>character’s Margin of Success becomes the modifier used by<br>anyone attempting to decode the message without a cipher.<br> (If the check fails, the transmission or data is not properly<br>encoded, and will be automatically translated by anyone who<br>receives the information.)<br> Attempting to decode a message or data with the proper cipher<br>does not require a Cryptography Skill Check as long as the<br>decoding character also has the Cryptography Skill.<br> (If the decoder lacks the Skill, an untrained Skill Check is<br>needed instead.)<br>Encoding or decoding transmissions or data electronically is<br>accomplished within seconds or minutes, depending on the<br>amount of data to be decoded. Encoding or decoding<br>transmissions and data manually can be extremely<br>time-consuming, requiring numerous man-hours.
Demolitions;DEMOLITIONS<br>Subskills: None<br>The ability to rig, use, arm and disarm explosives,<br>as well as determining the best quantity, power<br>and placement of explosive charges, is covered by<br>the Demolitions Skill. While most explosives follow<br>the brute force rule (if it’s not working, you’re<br>not using enough), the safe use of explosives—<br>and, more importantly, the ability to disable<br>them without detonation—requires training.<br>Demolitions Skill Checks are needed any time a<br>character attempts to set up or disable an explosive<br>device. Modifi ers for setting up explosives include<br>diffi culty modifiers for less than ideal placement or<br>insuffi cient explosive materials, or for working with<br>particularly crude or unstable components. The<br>Margin of Success on a successful explosives set-<br>up check will translate into the penalty modifier<br>for anyone attempting to disable the device.<br>There is little margin for error when handling or<br>disarming explosives, which should be reflected by<br>the dire consequences of a failed Demolitions Skill<br>Check. If the character fails to set up an explosive<br>by a MoF of 5 or more, the explosives prematurely<br>detonate, immediately doing their maximum<br>damage to the character. The same result occurs if a<br>character fails a disarming Demolitions Skill Check<br>with any MoF of 3 or more. Any other failed result<br>simply means that the device fails to arm or disarm,<br>respectively.
Disguise;DISGUISE<br>Subskills: None<br>The Disguise Skill is used to adjust one’s own appearance to<br>avoid recognition (or to be taken for someone else). Modifiers<br>apply to Action Checks for this Skill based on the equipment (or<br>lack thereof ) that the disguising character has on hand to make<br>the change, as well as on what features and changes the character<br>is attempting to accomplish and how. The gamemaster should<br>defi ne the possible modifi ers for such an Action Check up front,<br>based on how radically the character is making his change.<br>If successful, the disguising character’s MoS applies as a penalty<br>against any Perception Skill Checks to see through the ruse. (If the<br>perceiving character also has Disguise, however, his own Disguise<br>Skill level can be applied as a bonus to the Perception Check,<br>since he will more likely recognize the tricks of the trade.) A failed<br>Disguise Check means the altered look is simply too obvious to<br>work with.<br> A successful Acting Skill Check can further enhance the<br>effectiveness of a good disguise. If a character successfully makes<br>both a Disguise and an Acting Skill Check, the MoS for both<br>Skills will apply to the perceiving character’s Perception Check to<br>penetrate the disguise.
Driving/Ground Vehicles;DRIVING<br>Subskills: Ground Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, Sea Vehicles<br> The ability to operate and drive surface-based vehicles and<br>vessels is determined by the Driving Skill. In general, Driving<br>focuses on vehicles designed to be piloted by a single driver,<br>but larger units that require multiple pilots still rely on a single<br>navigator/master driver who directs the unit’s overall motion.<br>Because all vehicles tend to vary, gamemasters may apply<br>penalties to Driving Skill Checks if the character finds himself<br>operating a vehicle or vessel that he is not accustomed to,<br>especially if the vehicle has radically different performance<br>specs from his regular ride (such as attempting to drive an<br>ultra-swift, ultra-light Savannah Master hovercraft after long<br>years behind the wheel of a large and lumbering Demolisher<br>assault tank). Because vehicles can be regarded as tactical<br>units, more detailed rules for their operation may be found<br>under the relevant movement rules chapters in Total Warfare,<br>Tactical Operations and Strategic Operations.<br>The Driving Skill broadly covers three main vehicle<br>classes in A Time of War with the following subskills: Ground<br>Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, and Sea Vehicles.<br> Ground Vehicles: Ground Vehicles include any vehicle<br>designed to operate primarily on land (or just above it), and<br>includes Combat and Support Vehicles with wheeled, tracked<br>or hover-based motive systems.
Driving/Rail Vehicles;DRIVING<br>Subskills: Ground Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, Sea Vehicles<br> The ability to operate and drive surface-based vehicles and<br>vessels is determined by the Driving Skill. In general, Driving<br>focuses on vehicles designed to be piloted by a single driver,<br>but larger units that require multiple pilots still rely on a single<br>navigator/master driver who directs the unit’s overall motion.<br>Because all vehicles tend to vary, gamemasters may apply<br>penalties to Driving Skill Checks if the character finds himself<br>operating a vehicle or vessel that he is not accustomed to,<br>especially if the vehicle has radically different performance<br>specs from his regular ride (such as attempting to drive an<br>ultra-swift, ultra-light Savannah Master hovercraft after long<br>years behind the wheel of a large and lumbering Demolisher<br>assault tank). Because vehicles can be regarded as tactical<br>units, more detailed rules for their operation may be found<br>under the relevant movement rules chapters in Total Warfare,<br>Tactical Operations and Strategic Operations.<br>The Driving Skill broadly covers three main vehicle<br>classes in A Time of War with the following subskills: Ground<br>Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, and Sea Vehicles.<br> Rail Vehicles: This specialized subskill covers all rail vehicles,<br>including conventional trains and magnetic levitation (maglev)<br>vehicles.
Driving/Sea Vehicles;DRIVING<br>Subskills: Ground Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, Sea Vehicles<br> The ability to operate and drive surface-based vehicles and<br>vessels is determined by the Driving Skill. In general, Driving<br>focuses on vehicles designed to be piloted by a single driver,<br>but larger units that require multiple pilots still rely on a single<br>navigator/master driver who directs the unit’s overall motion.<br>Because all vehicles tend to vary, gamemasters may apply<br>penalties to Driving Skill Checks if the character finds himself<br>operating a vehicle or vessel that he is not accustomed to,<br>especially if the vehicle has radically different performance<br>specs from his regular ride (such as attempting to drive an<br>ultra-swift, ultra-light Savannah Master hovercraft after long<br>years behind the wheel of a large and lumbering Demolisher<br>assault tank). Because vehicles can be regarded as tactical<br>units, more detailed rules for their operation may be found<br>under the relevant movement rules chapters in Total Warfare,<br>Tactical Operations and Strategic Operations.<br>The Driving Skill broadly covers three main vehicle<br>classes in A Time of War with the following subskills: Ground<br>Vehicles, Rail Vehicles, and Sea Vehicles.<br> Sea Vehicles: Sea Vehicles includes displacement hull,<br>hydrofoil and submersible vessels designed for operation on<br>(or under) water, and therefore covers all Combat and Support<br>Vehicles with such motive systems.
Escape Artist;ESCAPE ARTIST<br>Subskills: None<br>The Escape Artist Skill is used to defeat restraints placed on<br>the character’s person. (Locks and other devices established to<br>trap a character in—or keep the character out of—a room are<br>defeated using the Security Systems Skill.) Gamemasters may<br>modify any Escape Artist roll based on the sophistication of the<br>restraints that bind the character, as well as any tools or other<br>aids the character may be resourceful enough to obtain.<br>
Forgery;FORGERY<br>Subskills: None<br>Most modern official documents contain a number of<br>devices intended to prevent them being copied without being<br>identifi able as a copy or new product (the most eff ective being<br>the DNA-triggered verigraph, which is often used to validate<br>ComStar documents). Yet despite these efforts, the methods<br>and means to falsify such documents have also evolved, and<br>their use is covered under the Forgery Skill.<br> When attempting to create a copy of offi cial documents, a<br>character uses Forgery Skill, with a difficulty modifier based<br>on the sophistication of the document’s verification devices<br>and the tools at the character’s disposal. For example, simple<br>handwritten signatures—fairly easy to reproduce—apply<br>a minimal modifier of +0 to –1 to reproduce by hand (an<br>electronic replication may even give the character a bonus),<br>while eff orts to reproduce a verigraph may apply a more<br>extreme –4 to –6 penalty to pull off , even with sophisticated<br>electronic equipment at the forger’s disposal.<br> When attempting to determine whether a document<br>has been forged, the MoS of the forger is used as a penalty<br>against the opposing character’s Perception or Investigation<br>Skill Checks. If the perceiving character has the Forgery Skill<br>himself, that Skill’s modifi er may be applied to the effort to<br>detect the fraud. Without the Skill, however, or any other tools<br>to penetrate the ruse, additional penalties may apply to the<br>Perception or Investigation Check.
Gunnery/Aerospace;GUNNERY<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, Ground Vehicle,<br>’Mech, ProtoMech, Sea Vehicle, Spacecraft, Turret<br>The Gunnery Skill is used by operators of most Combat<br>Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits, and aerospace units to aim and<br>fi re the unit’s onboard weaponry in combat. The modifiers<br>that apply to these Skills are described in the relevant combat<br>chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations and Strategic<br>Operations (though it is important to remember that such<br>modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while A<br>Time of War inverts the same modifi ers and applies them to the<br>Skill Check for the same outcomes). The Gunnery Skill reflects<br>the use of weapons mounted directly on a broad range of<br>units, many of which have very diff erent functional interfaces.<br>As a result, Gunnery has a number of subskills, which must be<br>specifi ed at character creation.<br> Aerospace: Gunnery/Aerospace covers the use of all<br>weapons mounted on small aerospace units, including<br>aerospace fi ghters, Small Craft and Satellite Support Vehicles.
Gunnery/Air Vehicle;GUNNERY<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, Ground Vehicle,<br>’Mech, ProtoMech, Sea Vehicle, Spacecraft, Turret<br>The Gunnery Skill is used by operators of most Combat<br>Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits, and aerospace units to aim and<br>fi re the unit’s onboard weaponry in combat. The modifiers<br>that apply to these Skills are described in the relevant combat<br>chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations and Strategic<br>Operations (though it is important to remember that such<br>modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while A<br>Time of War inverts the same modifi ers and applies them to the<br>Skill Check for the same outcomes).

Gunnery/Battlesuit;GUNNERY<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, Ground Vehicle,<br>’Mech, ProtoMech, Sea Vehicle, Spacecraft, Turret<br>The Gunnery Skill is used by operators of most Combat<br>Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits, and aerospace units to aim and<br>fi re the unit’s onboard weaponry in combat. The modifiers<br>that apply to these Skills are described in the relevant combat<br>chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations and Strategic<br>Operations (though it is important to remember that such<br>modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while A<br>Time of War inverts the same modifi ers and applies them to the<br>Skill Check for the same outcomes).

(For smaller weapons carried by the suit’s<br>manipulators or armored gloves, the appropriate Small Arms<br>or Support Weapons Skill applies instead.)
Gunnery/Ground Vehicle;GUNNERY<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, Ground Vehicle,<br>’Mech, ProtoMech, Sea Vehicle, Spacecraft, Turret<br>The Gunnery Skill is used by operators of most Combat<br>Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits, and aerospace units to aim and<br>fi re the unit’s onboard weaponry in combat.

Gunnery/Turret;GUNNERY<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, Ground Vehicle,<br>’Mech, ProtoMech, Sea Vehicle, Spacecraft, Turret<br>The Gunnery Skill is used by operators of most Combat<br>Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits, and aerospace units to aim and<br>fi re the unit’s onboard weaponry in combat. The modifiers<br>that apply to these Skills are described in the relevant combat<br>chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations and Strategic<br>Operations (though it is important to remember that such<br>modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while A<br>Time of War inverts the same modifi ers and applies them to the<br>Skill Check for the same outcomes).

Interests;INTEREST<br>Subskills: Any academic or cultural pursuit or hobby<br>(History, Literature, Holo-Games, Sports Statistics and so on).<br> The Interest Skill is another great catchall Skill that includes<br>any specifi c area of study or specialized knowledge a character<br>possesses that is not covered by any other Skill on the character’s<br>record sheet.<br> Interest Skill Checks are used only to resolve tasks that fall<br>within the character’s area of interest, but are not adequately<br>represented by other Skills within this chapter. If the character<br>possesses another Skill that better fi ts a given situation, use that<br>Skill instead (even if it is at a lower level). For example, a technician<br>with the Interest/BattleMechs Skill at Level 4 cannot use it in place<br>of his Level 2 Technician/Nuclear Skill.<br> The gamemaster ultimately decides if a particular task in the<br>character’s job can be resolved using the Interest Skill, or must be<br>resolved with another Skill or Attribute Check.<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the difference between casual “hobby-<br>level” interests and a dedicated expert in a subject, Interest is<br>represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill, progressing from<br>simple training at the lowest four levels (0 through 3) to a more<br>advanced and focused form common among specialists and<br>consultants.
Interrogation;INTERROGATION<br>Subskills: None<br>The Interrogation Skill covers the ability to extract information<br>from an individual who is unwilling to yield any. Beyond simple<br>torture, intimidation and persuasiveness, this Skill includes the<br>ability to determine (within reason) whether a subject is telling<br>the truth or lying. (Whether the subject is correct or not is a<br>diff erent matter entirely.)<br> Modifiers to an Interrogation Skill Check must include<br>the subject’s WIL (subtracted from the roll, as a penalty),<br>and may account for additional eff ects, such as the subject’s<br>health (injured or fatigued subjects are easier to break), the<br>interrogator’s methods (chemicals, force or the old “good<br>interrogator/bad interrogator” routine may provide varying<br>eff ects) and the amount of time taken (longer periods can wear<br>a subject down as the prospect of escape or rescue wanes,<br>producing a bonus). A successful Interrogation Check can reveal<br>as much as one critical or useful piece of information per point<br>of MoS; a failed check can translate to learning nothing, or—if<br>violence or torture is involved—the subject’s injury or death at<br>the interrogator’s hand.
Investigation;INVESTIGATION<br>Subskills: None<br>The Investigation Skill is used to gather evidence toward the<br>solution of a particular mystery, and is a favored Skill among police<br>detectives, private security and intelligence operatives. Using a<br>structured approach toward information gathering, characters<br>skilled in Investigation can identify what avenues and sequences<br>of research will most likely produce results, and can tap a broad<br>range of sources for information and evidence pertaining to a<br>particular crime or other past action.<br> Investigation Skill Checks focus on hard evidence and research<br>(gathering evidence from witnesses falls under the Interrogation<br>Skill), and should apply modifi ers based on the amount of<br>evidence gathered so far, balanced against the actual suspect’s<br>eff orts to cover his tracks (if any). The process can take hours<br>or days depending on the investigator’s meticulousness, the<br>suspect’s caution, and pure dumb luck, with every successful roll<br>made after that period either eliminating one or more suspects or<br>adding one or more bits of signifi cant evidence—after which, the<br>process begins again. Failed Investigation Checks turn out to be<br>dead ends or false leads, wasting valuable resources and time the<br>investigator simply may not have.<br> The Investigation Skill has no subskills, but characters may<br>specialize in forensics (the analysis of physical evidence) or<br>research (the analysis of records and media) as a focus for their<br>evidence gathering.<br> Gamemasters should take great care, however; it can be all too<br>tempting for a player to roll his character’s way to the conclusion<br>of an investigation using this Skill.
Language;LANGUAGE<br>Subskills: Any specific language<br>A wide variety of languages exists within the BattleTech universe.<br> While standard English is spoken on almost every inhabited world,<br>most realms—and their member worlds—have also developed<br>layers of their own languages, dialects and terminology (some<br>dating back to pre-Exodus Terra) that combine to make interstellar<br>travel an enlightening experience in cultural diversity.<br>A character’s Language Skill identifi es the languages he can<br>speak, understand and (usually) read, with each Language<br>subskill identifying one language in the character’s repertoire.<br> Language Skill Checks are almost never necessary in game<br>play; the character is generally considered to be automatically<br>successful at understanding any language for which he has a<br>Skill Level of 0 (though he will speak it with a pronounced local<br>accent), and with basic reading comprehension possible at Level<br>1 (unless the character has the Illiterate Trait; see p. 119). At Level<br>2, the character attains enough ability in the language that he<br>can be understood by another character who has only recently<br>learned the words himself (eff ectively eradicating the worst of his<br>accent), while a character at Level 3 is considered fl uent. At a Skill<br>Level of 4 or higher, the character’s command of the language<br>is considered excellent, with an expanded vocabulary and clear<br>enough enunciation to be easily understood anywhere the<br>language is spoken.
Leadership;LEADERSHIP<br>Subskills: None<br>The Leadership Skill is used to inspire and motivate subordinates<br>to follow the character’s commands, and is a common Skill among<br>military and political leaders (for obvious reasons). A Leadership<br>Skill Check is typically not required in normal game play, but may<br>be called for when attempting to exhort NPCs to do something<br>questionable or potentially suicidal (in which case, a penalty<br>modifi er should be applied that refl ect s th e relativ e danger<br>presented by following the command).<br> The Leadership Skill can also provide an Initiative bonus to<br>a team of characters during personal combat (see p. 166) as<br>long as the character using the Skill is, in fact, in command<br>of the team and able to communicate with them during the<br>battle. Leadership can also provide an Initiative bonus in<br>tactical combat (see p. 204) at the gamemaster’s discretion (as<br>it means the enemy’s Leadership Skill should also be applied).
Martial Arts;MARTIAL ARTS<br>Subskills: None<br>At its most basic levels, the Martial Arts Skill represents<br>the character’s prowess in unarmed (or virtually unarmed)<br>melee combat. With this Skill, the character’s fists and feet<br>are weapons, though not until he achieves higher levels of<br>expertise can the character exchange brute force, adrenaline<br>and fury with the skilled focus of a true fi ghter.<br> The rules for using the Martial Arts Skill in personal combat<br>appear on pp. 175-177. Specialties exist that encompass the<br>various styles of martial arts available (such as boxing, gung<br>fu, karate and the like), but in A Time of War, these specialties<br>merely refl ect the potential attained in advanced Martial Arts<br>Skill levels. Though each style has its strengths and weaknesses,<br>the basic rules remain the same in standard game play.<br> Tiered Skill: To refl ect the diff erence between crude street<br>fi ghting and the skills of a honed hand-to-hand killer, Martial<br>Arts is represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill, progressing<br>from simple training at the lowest four levels (0 through 3) to a<br>more advanced and sophisticated style available only through<br>dedicated training and experience. Even though a character<br>may spend all of his martial arts training career learning judo,<br>karate and other specialized fi ghting forms, it is only after<br>reaching advanced levels (4 and up) that these styles truly<br>take hold and enable the character to deliver stronger and<br>more precise blows in combat.
MedTech/General;MEDTECH<br>Subskills: General, Veterinary<br> The MedTech Skill represents basic medical training,<br>including everything from fi rst aid (Skill Level 0) to basic<br>pharmacology and other “field medicine.” A skilled MedTech<br>can stabilize wounded characters in combat, treat characters<br>who have undergone surgery and who are in recovery, and<br>perform all duties and procedures that might be asked of a<br>nurse or a clinical doctor, but falls just shy of being able to<br>perform major surgery. Additional rules covering the use of<br>MedTech Skills in game play are described under Healing and<br>Recovery in the Personal Combat chapter (see pp. 192-195).<br>MedTech has two main subskills: General and Veterinary.<br> General: MedTech/General is the subskill used to treat<br>human patients in A Time of War.
MedTech/Veterinary;MEDTECH<br>Subskills: General, Veterinary<br> The MedTech Skill represents basic medical training,<br>including everything from fi rst aid (Skill Level 0) to basic<br>pharmacology and other “field medicine.” A skilled MedTech<br>can stabilize wounded characters in combat, treat characters<br>who have undergone surgery and who are in recovery, and<br>perform all duties and procedures that might be asked of a<br>nurse or a clinical doctor, but falls just shy of being able to<br>perform major surgery. Additional rules covering the use of<br>MedTech Skills in game play are described under Healing and<br>Recovery in the Personal Combat chapter (see pp. 192-195).<br>MedTech has two main subskills: General and Veterinary.<br> Veterinary: The MedTech/Veterinary subskill is used in<br>the treatment of animals. However, given the sheer diversity<br>of life in the BattleTech universe, veterinary MedTechs should<br>further defi ne their area of expertise with a specialty species<br>or class of species (examples might include Avians, Terrestrial<br>Mammals or Trachzoi).
Melee Weapons;MELEE WEAPONS<br>Subskills: None<br> Similar to Martial Arts, the Melee Weapons Skill has two<br>effective levels of sophistication. At its most basic, the Melee<br>Weapons Skill represents the character’s ability to use a<br>variety of close-quarters weapons, from knives and clubs to<br>whips and staves. Using this Skill grants the character some<br>eff ectiveness with such basic weaponry, but only at higher<br>levels of expertise does the character abandon the wild swings<br>and over-powered lunges of basic knife-fighting in favor of<br>the fi nesse of swordfi ghting.<br>The rules for using the Melee Weapons Skill in personal<br>combat appear on pp. 175-177. Though melee weapons vary<br>greatly, specialties—rather than subskills—are recommended<br>to emphasize the character’s greater expertise with any one class<br>of melee weapon. Recommended specialties include Blades<br>(covering weapons like daggers, shivs, swords and most vibro-<br>weapons), Blunt Weapons (covering clubs, maces and staves)<br>and Whips (covering non-rigid melee weapons such as chains,<br>flails, nunchaku and lashes).<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the difference between rudimentary<br>knife-fi ghting and the skills of a close-in weapons master,<br>Melee Weapons is represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill,<br>progressing from simple training at the lowest four levels (0<br>through 3), to more advanced and sophisticated techniques<br>available only through dedicated training and experience.
Navigation/Air;NAVIGATION<br>Subskills: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea, Space<br> Travelling to a specific destination is impossible without luck,<br>signs or the Navigation Skill. A character with this Skill can use<br>various tools, such as maps, compasses, electronic navigational<br>instruments and so on to determine his location, and how to get<br>wherever he wants to go. A Navigation Skill Check isn’t necessary<br>every time a character tries to go somewhere, especially if he is<br>already familiar with traveling to and from the location in question,<br>but it may be used periodically in unfamiliar territories, or when<br>lost behind enemy lines.<br>Navigation has fi ve main subskills, each based on a different<br>traveling medium: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea and Space.<br> Air: Navigation/Air is the Skill used to plot an aircraft’s course<br>through a planetary atmosphere, identifying the safest and most<br>effi cient routes around weather phenomena, locating emergency<br>landing sites in the event of danger, and finding one’s way with<br>the aid of anything from local starlight and compass readings to<br>state-of-the-art sensors and air-traffic control input.
Navigation/Ground;NAVIGATION<br>Subskills: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea, Space<br> Travelling to a specific destination is impossible without luck,<br>signs or the Navigation Skill. A character with this Skill can use<br>various tools, such as maps, compasses, electronic navigational<br>instruments and so on to determine his location, and how to get<br>wherever he wants to go. A Navigation Skill Check isn’t necessary<br>every time a character tries to go somewhere, especially if he is<br>already familiar with traveling to and from the location in question,<br>but it may be used periodically in unfamiliar territories, or when<br>lost behind enemy lines.<br>Navigation has fi ve main subskills, each based on a different<br>traveling medium: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea and Space.<br> Ground: The Navigation/Ground Skill covers finding one’s way on<br>highways and byways, as well as in the deep wilderness on foot.
Navigation/K-F Jump;NAVIGATION<br>Subskills: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea, Space<br> Travelling to a specific destination is impossible without luck,<br>signs or the Navigation Skill. A character with this Skill can use<br>various tools, such as maps, compasses, electronic navigational<br>instruments and so on to determine his location, and how to get<br>wherever he wants to go. A Navigation Skill Check isn’t necessary<br>every time a character tries to go somewhere, especially if he is<br>already familiar with traveling to and from the location in question,<br>but it may be used periodically in unfamiliar territories, or when<br>lost behind enemy lines.<br>Navigation has fi ve main subskills, each based on a different<br>traveling medium: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea and Space.<br> K-F Jump: The Navigation/K-F Jump Skill is used to plot safe<br>jump points and identify the most efficient interstellar routes<br>for JumpShips and WarShips traveling between worlds. Use of<br>this Skill relies heavily on the vessel’s computers and a wealth of<br>astronomical data, enabling the navigator to plot courses using<br>either the conventional “safe” destinations of solar zenith and<br>nadir jump points, or the far more unpredictable and risky pirate<br>points that dot every planetary system.
Navigation/Sea;NAVIGATION<br>Subskills: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea, Space<br> Travelling to a specific destination is impossible without luck,<br>signs or the Navigation Skill. A character with this Skill can use<br>various tools, such as maps, compasses, electronic navigational<br>instruments and so on to determine his location, and how to get<br>wherever he wants to go. A Navigation Skill Check isn’t necessary<br>every time a character tries to go somewhere, especially if he is<br>already familiar with traveling to and from the location in question,<br>but it may be used periodically in unfamiliar territories, or when<br>lost behind enemy lines.<br>Navigation has fi ve main subskills, each based on a different<br>traveling medium: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea and Space.<br> Sea: The Navigation/Sea Skill is used to guide water-based<br>vessels at (and under) sea, using any aids available from the<br>placement of stars in the night sky and simple compasses to the<br>latest in GPS technology.
Navigation/Space;NAVIGATION<br>Subskills: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea, Space<br> Travelling to a specific destination is impossible without luck,<br>signs or the Navigation Skill. A character with this Skill can use<br>various tools, such as maps, compasses, electronic navigational<br>instruments and so on to determine his location, and how to get<br>wherever he wants to go. A Navigation Skill Check isn’t necessary<br>every time a character tries to go somewhere, especially if he is<br>already familiar with traveling to and from the location in question,<br>but it may be used periodically in unfamiliar territories, or when<br>lost behind enemy lines.<br>Navigation has fi ve main subskills, each based on a different<br>traveling medium: Air, Ground, K-F Jump, Sea and Space.<br> Space: The Navigation/Space Skill is used to pilot spacecraft in<br>deep space, using magnetic cues, electronic signs and the like to<br>guide a spacecraft safely between distant points (such as from a<br>star system’s zenith recharge station to its primary planet).
Negotiation;NEGOTIATION<br>Subskills: None<br> At its simplest, the Negotiation Skill is used to reach a<br>compromise between two or more parties, be it for political,<br>commercial or legal reasons. As a Skill, Negotiation requires no<br>roll if the haggling characters are all player characters: it should<br>be simple enough for two players to role-play their way through<br>a discussion among themselves rather than let the dice decide<br>for them.<br> To resolve a negotiation with an NPC, however, this Skill<br>becomes almost paramount, as the negotiating player character<br>must now pit his Negotiation Skill (if any) against that of the subject<br>in a straight Opposed Action Check. At the gamemaster’s<br>discretion, additional modifi ers may be applied to the player<br>character’s roll, to refl ect stubbornness or reluctance on the<br>opposing NPC’s part.<br> A successful negotiation on the player character’s part will<br>earn him some concessions from the NPC. If the negotiation<br>is about money or other quantifiable resources, it can reduce<br>an asking price by up to 5 percent per point of net MoS (or<br>force the NPC to accept a price up to 5 percent higher than<br>he wished for, per net MoS point). If the discussion is about<br>politics, the NPC may concede a key point or promise some<br>degree of political support. If legal, the NPC will plea bargain<br>more in the player character’s favor. A failed negotiation<br>means the NPC does not budge; if the roll is bad enough, it<br>can even represent a walk-out in the midst of the negotiations<br>as the NPC decides to break off talks.<br> The Negotiation Skill has no subskills, but characters may<br>specialize in commercial, legal or political negotiations if they<br>are in a profession that could benefi t from such specialization.<br>Commercial Negotiation Skills cover the terms and conditions<br>surrounding the procurement and pricing of goods and services:<br>legal Negotiation Skills focus on litigation and determining guilt<br>or innocence in accordance with local laws. Finally, political<br>Negotiation Skills cover public debates, policy discussions, the<br>winning over of allies and/or the placating of enemies.
Perception;PERCEPTION<br>Subskills: None<br> Perception determines a character’s awareness of his<br>surroundings, and is one of the most commonly used<br>Skills in A Time of War. With this Skill, the character uses<br>all his senses (not just his eyes and ears) to spot signs of<br>danger or clues to a puzzle in his immediate environment,<br>though modifi ers may apply based on darkness, weather<br>conditions, atmospheric taints and other sensory-affecting<br>conditions. Whether attempting to spot an unusual shadow<br>or movement that could be a hidden sniper, or picking up<br>on the non-verbal signals given off by other people trying to<br>convey a message, Perception Skill Checks can be made any<br>time the character decides to scrutinize his environment and<br>other individuals around him. Searching a location requires<br>a Perception Check, as does conducting surveillance or<br>eavesdropping on a conversation. Yet for all its applications,<br>gamemasters and players should be careful not to overuse<br>the Perception Skill, as constant dice rolling to sniff out signs<br>and clues can leave the character totally unprepared to deal<br>with the dangers he’s overlooked.
Piloting/Aerospace;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> Aerospace: Piloting/Aerospace covers control and flight<br>systems used by small aerospace units, including aerospace<br>fi ghters, Small Craft and Satellite Support Vehicles.
Piloting/Air Vehicle;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> Air Vehicle: Piloting/Air Vehicle covers control and flight<br>systems used by atmospheric-only units, including Airship Support<br>Vehicles, conventional fighters, VTOLs and WiGE vehicles.
Piloting/Battlesuit;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> Battlesuit: Piloting/Battlesuit covers control and operation of<br>battle armor, power armor (light) and exoskeletons. Though such<br>suits are more worn than “driven” by their operators, this Skill<br>covers their operation, whether designed with humanoid chassis<br>or as four-legged.
Piloting/'Mech;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> ’Mech: Piloting/’Mech covers control and operation of<br>BattleMechs and IndustrialMechs, including biped and four-legged<br>chassis and the use of any non-ranged industrial equipment and<br>melee combat weapons if necessary.
Piloting/ProtoMech;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> ProtoMech: Piloting/ProtoMech applies to control and<br>operation of ProtoMechs.
Piloting/Spacecraft;PILOTING<br>Subskills: Aerospace, Air Vehicle, Battlesuit, ’Mech,<br>ProtoMech, Spacecraft<br> The Piloting Skill is used by operators of most Combat and<br>Support Vehicles, ’Mechs, battlesuits and aerospace units to<br>control and maneuver their vehicles in and out of combat.<br> The modifiers that apply to these Skills are described in the<br>relevant combat chapters for Total Warfare, Tactical Operations<br>and Strategic Operations (though it is important to remember that<br>such modifi ers are applied to the roll TNs in those rulebooks, while<br>A Time of War inverts the modifi ers and applies them to the Skill<br>Check for the same outcomes). Given the wide range of vehicles<br>and other units available in the thirty-fi rst century universe, a<br>correspondingly wide range of subskills exists for Piloting, which<br>must be specifi ed at character creation.<br> Spacecraft: Piloting/Spacecraft applies to control and flight<br>systems used by larger aerospace units, including DropShips,<br>JumpShips, WarShips and Space Stations.
Prestidigitation/Pick Pocket;PRESTIDIGITATION<br>Subskills: Pick Pocket, Quickdraw, Sleight of Hand<br> Characters skilled in Prestidigitation have trained their manual<br>dexterity to an exceptional degree. They are capable of manual<br>feats in excess of the average person, even those who are naturally<br>very dexterous.<br>This Skill can be used in a variety of ways, each identified as a<br>subskill below.<br> Pick Pocket: Prestidigitation/Pick Pocket is used to<br>surreptitiously remove items from a person. To determine if<br>the victim remains unaware of the event, the pick-pocketing<br>character and his victim should roll an Opposed Action Check,<br>pitting the pickpocket’s Prestidigitation against the victim’s<br>Perception. If the pickpocket fails, he’s caught red-handed. If<br>not, he can slide back into the shadows undetected (and likely<br>somewhat richer for the effort.)<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the difference between casual “hobby-<br>level” prestidigitation and the skills of a dedicated professional,<br>Prestidigitation is represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill,<br>progressing from simple training at the lowest four levels (0<br>through 3) to a more advanced and focused form that separates<br>the magicians from the simple tricksters.
Prestidigitation/Quickdraw;PRESTIDIGITATION<br>Subskills: Pick Pocket, Quickdraw, Sleight of Hand<br> Characters skilled in Prestidigitation have trained their manual<br>dexterity to an exceptional degree. They are capable of manual<br>feats in excess of the average person, even those who are naturally<br>very dexterous.<br>This Skill can be used in a variety of ways, each identified as a<br>subskill below.<br> Quickdraw: This subskill is used to quickly prepare a small<br>weapon for use, hopefully before the character’s would-be<br>opponent can react. A successful Prestidigitation/Quickdraw<br>Check gives the player character a free action to prepare his<br>weapons before others can act. Failure means the character’s<br>move is so clumsy and awkward that he loses the element of<br>surprise, or he fumbles and drops the weapon.<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the difference between casual “hobby-<br>level” prestidigitation and the skills of a dedicated professional,<br>Prestidigitation is represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill,<br>progressing from simple training at the lowest four levels (0<br>through 3) to a more advanced and focused form that separates<br>the magicians from the simple tricksters.
Prestidigitation/Sleight of Hand;PRESTIDIGITATION<br>Subskills: Pick Pocket, Quickdraw, Sleight of Hand<br> Characters skilled in Prestidigitation have trained their manual<br>dexterity to an exceptional degree. They are capable of manual<br>feats in excess of the average person, even those who are naturally<br>very dexterous.<br>This Skill can be used in a variety of ways, each identified as a<br>subskill below.<br> Sleight of Hand: Prestidigitation/Sleight of Hand reflects<br>the ability to produce (or make disappear) small objects with a<br>dexterous fl air. Characters can use this Skill to pilfer objects kept<br>in plain sight, or to entertain others with feats of wonder.<br> Tiered Skill: To reflect the difference between casual “hobby-<br>level” prestidigitation and the skills of a dedicated professional,<br>Prestidigitation is represented in A Time of War as a Tiered Skill,<br>progressing from simple training at the lowest four levels (0<br>through 3) to a more advanced and focused form that separates<br>the magicians from the simple tricksters.
Protocol;PROTOCOL<br>Subskills: By Affiliation<br> A Character skilled in Protocol is aware of the formalities, bylaws,<br>quirks and red tape associated with a particular faction’s political<br>rulers and high society. A successful roll using this Skill can help the<br>character navigate the bureaucracy and get things done through<br>the proper channels. Career officers and businessmen are often<br>strong in Protocol, and in some nations it affects promotion to a<br>greater degree than competence.<br> A typical Protocol Skill Check is used whenever the character<br>seeks to cash in a favor or hook up with a contact in the local<br>government or military apparatus. The difficulty of this effort<br>depends on the character’s relative importance, how busy<br>his local connections may be, and what resources he’s willing<br>to trade to gain an audience. A successful Protocol Check can<br>also help the character avoid embarrassing slips by identifying<br>the important people at a local political or social event, and<br>recognize any quirks in local customs necessary to win respect<br>and minimize off ense.<br> Subskills: As social, legal and bureaucratic customs vary<br>greatly between realms and Clans, the Protocol Skill employs the<br>Affiliation of its use as a subskill. A character with the Protocol/<br>Lyran Alliance Skill, for example, would be completely out of his<br>element in the Draconis Combine (though he could later pick up<br>Protocol/Draconis Combine to circumvent that).
Running;RUNNING<br>Subskills: None<br> Except for the handicapped, virtually all characters in A Time of<br>War can run, but characters with the Running Skill have trained<br>themselves to run farther, faster and longer than the average<br>Joe. A Running Skill Check in game play is virtually unheard of,<br>but characters with this Skill can add its level to their Running<br>MP in personal combat (see Movement, p. 167), thereby gaining<br>a real advantage. 
Science;SCIENCE<br>Subskills: Any major scientific field (examples: Biology,<br>Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and so on)<br> In the warlike future of the thirty-first century, scientific<br>advancement may have slowed to a crawl, but humankind’s<br>understanding of the sciences was never truly lost. The Science<br>Skill refl ects extensive academic and hands-on knowledge of<br>a particular fi eld of major science such as Biology, Chemistry,<br>Metallurgy and so on, that is not covered by an existing<br>Technician Skill.<br>Science Skill Checks are used only to resolve tasks that fall<br>within the character’s fi eld of scientifi c study , but that are not<br>adequately represented by the other Skills in this chapter. As<br>with Career and Interest Skills, if the character possesses another<br>Skill that better fi ts a given situation, use that Skill instead (even<br>if it is of a lower level). For example, a doctor confronted with a<br>badly injured patient cannot use his Level 3 Science/Biology Skill<br>in place of his Level 1 Surgery Skill. On the other hand, a doctor<br>may use Science/Chemistry to identify the nature of a toxin<br>found in his patient’s bloodstream during a routine exam.<br> The gamemaster ultimately decides if a particular task can<br>be resolved using the Science Skill, or must be resolved with<br>another Skill or Attribute Check.
Security Systems/Electronic;SECURITY SYSTEMS<br>Subskills: Electronic, Mechanical<br> The Security Systems Skill is used to analyze and—if<br>necessary—defeat locks, locking mechanisms, sensors and<br>other instruments designed to protect a facility against<br>intrusion, or to keep prisoners trapped inside. (This Skill is<br>not used to install such systems; installation is covered by the<br>appropriate Technician Skill instead.) Modifi ers to a Security<br>Systems Check apply based on the complexity of the locking<br>mechanisms and any tools the character has on hand to defeat<br>them. A successful roll will disable or destroy an off ending lock<br>mechanism, sensor or similar security system, while failed rolls<br>either leave them intact and active or trigger an alarm that can<br>summon hostile guards in moments.<br> The Security Systems Skill has two main subskills: Electronic<br>and Mechanical.<br> Electronic: The Security Systems/Electronic Skill is used<br>primarily to defeat electronic locking mechanisms such as<br>code-key accessed devices and electro-magnetic safety locks.<br> It can also be used to interrupt, disable or scramble sensor<br>feeds, though such eff orts may set off alarms if the local<br>guards are alert enough.
Security Systems/Mechanical;SECURITY SYSTEMS<br>Subskills: Electronic, Mechanical<br> The Security Systems Skill is used to analyze and—if<br>necessary—defeat locks, locking mechanisms, sensors and<br>other instruments designed to protect a facility against<br>intrusion, or to keep prisoners trapped inside. (This Skill is<br>not used to install such systems; installation is covered by the<br>appropriate Technician Skill instead.) Modifi ers to a Security<br>Systems Check apply based on the complexity of the locking<br>mechanisms and any tools the character has on hand to defeat<br>them. A successful roll will disable or destroy an off ending lock<br>mechanism, sensor or similar security system, while failed rolls<br>either leave them intact and active or trigger an alarm that can<br>summon hostile guards in moments.<br> The Security Systems Skill has two main subskills: Electronic<br>and Mechanical.<br> Mechanical: Mechanical security systems generally use<br>simple manual controls and other low-tech means that cannot<br>be hacked or otherwise compromised electronically. In general,<br>a combination of brute force and fi nesse can overcome most<br>mechanical locks and primitive mechanical sensors (such as<br>tripwires and other crude booby traps), though the skilled<br>Security Systems master often carries personal lock-picking<br>equipment for just such an emergency.
Sensor Operations;SENSOR OPERATIONS<br>Subskills: None<br> The operation of sensor suites (as found in most Combat<br>Vehicles and all spacecraft) requires the use of the Sensor<br>Operations skill. When piloting a vehicle in combat, this Skill<br>generally acts as a second Perception Skill (see p. 151), but<br>covers targets that can be detected by artifi cial sensors rather<br>than by visual sighting alone. When attempting to spot a target<br>using motion detectors or radar, seismic, magnetic or infrared<br>sensors and their like, use the Sensor Operations Skill.<br> In tactical game play, Skill Checks are not generally required<br>for using sensors, but gamemasters can add fl avor by allowing<br>characters to make sensor sweeps for specifi c searches or<br>when attempting to uncover booby traps and ambushes,<br>assigning modifi ers based on the potential targets and the<br>character’s familiarity with the sensor suite. The use of any<br>specialty or advanced sensor equipment can further enhance<br>the character’s effectiveness, translating to bonus modifiers<br>on the Sensor Operations Skill Check.
Small Arms;SMALL ARMS<br>Subskills: None<br>This skill covers handheld weapons of various types, and<br>is used to execute any ranged weapon attack delivered by a<br>fi rearm or energy weapon not covered by the Archery, Support<br>Weapons or Thrown Weapons Skills. The Small Arms Skill does<br>not use subskills as such, but the sheer variety of such weapons<br>can encourage player characters to specialize. Recommended<br>specializations include slug-throwers (ballistic weaponry), lasers<br>(energy-based handheld weapons), burst weapons (including<br>submachine guns and pulse lasers), shotguns (a category that also<br>covers fl echette weapons like needlers), Gauss weapons (magnetic-<br>projectile weapons), rifl es (long-barreled firearm s designed for<br>greater range) and gyrojets (self-propelled mini-rocket weapons).<br> Full rules for the use of small arms in personal combat may be<br>found under Ranged Combat Resolution (see pp. 171-175) in the<br>Personal Combat chapter.
Stealth;STEALTH<br>Subskills: None<br>The Stealth Skill governs the character’s ability to sneak past<br>people and to camoufl age other objects or persons against<br>detection. Modifi ers to a Stealth Check may be applied based on<br>the stealth equipment available to the character, local conditions<br>that aff ect visibility and sensors, and whatever possible means<br>observers might be using to detect intruders. How much or how<br>fast the stealthy character moves can also aff ect the Stealth Check.<br> With these modifi ers combined, the character’s Stealth Check<br>may be pitted in an Opposed Action Check against the opponent’s<br>Perception or Sensor Operations Check (as appropriate). If more<br>successful than the observer, the stealthy character remains<br>undetected. Failure may mean anything from the character’s<br>stealth arousing suspicion to his being completely revealed.
Strategy;STRATEGY<br>Subskills: None<br>Where the Tactics Skill (see p. 156) deals with the execution<br>and direction of combat actions in the immediate area, the<br>Strategy Skill tracks the grander scale of planetary and interstellar<br>warfare. Concerned with the movement and direction of large<br>forces, the neutralization or capture of major objectives, and the<br>maintenance of supply chains, strategic planning aims to win<br>wars, where tactical planning focuses on the battles that make<br>them up.<br> Characters may make Strategy Skill Checks to help identify<br>the overall goals for a major campaign, and to perceive clues<br>about any fl aws in an enemy’s campaign strategy. Modifi ers may<br>apply based on a lack of reliable intelligence or communications,<br>leading to fl awed analyses (and correspondingly bad planning). A<br>successful roll can enable a character to know where a critical flaw<br>exists in a current campaign plan, or even sniff out whether and<br>where an enemy army might be planning its next major off ensive.<br> But while superior strategy can win wars, gamemasters should<br>never allow a simple roll using this Skill to provide all the answers<br>for a campaign planner.<br> The Strategy Skill has no subskills per se, but characters may<br>specialize as desired at the planetary or interstellar levels to focus<br>their strategic acumen on winning worlds individually, or managing<br>the space lanes and brigades of troops in multi-world warfare.
Streetwise;STREETWISE<br>Subskills: By Affiliation<br>The Streetwise Skill represents the seamy underside of the<br>Protocol Skill in A Time of War. Where Protocol refl ects the customs<br>and formalities of law-abiding society (see p. 152), Streetwise<br>covers life outside the boundaries of governmental or noble<br>control. Streetwise characters use this Skill to fi nd opportunities,<br>gain contacts with persons of interest in less legitimate (or merely<br>less reputable) areas of human endeavor, or simply to circumvent<br>“the system” to obtain information, help or items that would<br>normally be unavailable.<br> A typical Streetwise Skill Check is used whenever the character<br>seeks to tap into the local underground scene or hook up with<br>a contact amid the local crime syndicates or counterculture. The<br>diffi culty of this eff ort depends on the character’s familiarity with<br>the local scene, how cautious his contacts may be, and what<br>resources he’s willing to trade to gain an audience. A successful<br>Streetwise Check can also help the character avoid dangerous<br>missteps by identifying the important people among the<br>criminal element and which of them might be an undercover law<br>enforcement agent (or worse).<br> Subskills: As a mirror of the society they feed off of, the customs<br>and practices of the underground tend to fall into similar themes<br>throughout major realms and Clans, and so the Streetwise Skill<br>employs the Affi liation of its use as its subskill. A character with the<br>Streetwise/Federated Suns Skill would be fairly good at navigating<br>the underbelly of a city on a Davion world, but virtually useless in<br>the back alleys of the Outworlds Alliance (unless he also picked up<br>the Streetwise/Outworlds Alliance Skill).
Support Weapons;SUPPORT WEAPONS<br>Subskills: None<br>The Support Weapons Skill covers the use of heavy personal<br>combat weapons of various types (typically referred to as medium<br>weapons in vehicle design, or support weapons among infantry).<br> Characters use the Support Weapons Skill to execute any ranged<br>weapon attack delivered by such weapons not already covered<br>by the Archery, Small Arms or Thrown Weapons Skills.<br> The Support Weapons Skill does not use subskills as such,<br>but the sheer variety of such weapons can encourage player<br>characters to specialize. Recommended specializations include<br>missiles (including LRMs, SRMs, and rockets), lasers (energy-<br>based support weapons, including particle cannons), burst<br>weapons (including machine guns and personal autocannons),<br>fl amers (incendiary weapons), Gauss weapons (magnetic-<br>projectile weapons) and recoilless weapons (long-barreled,<br>direct-fi re rockets and gyrojet weapons).<br> Full rules for the use of Support Weapons in personal combat<br>may be found under Ranged Combat Resolution (see pp. 171-175)<br>in the Personal Combat chapter.
Surgery/General;SURGERY<br>Subskills: General, Veterinary<br> The Surgery Skill follows roughly the same rules as the MedTech<br>Skill, but pertains more to cutting open a patient and dealing with<br>serious problems like vital organ damage, cancers and physical<br>reconstruction. A character with the Surgery Skill but no MedTech<br>Skill can perform all of the actions appropriate to MedTech<br>without having to make an untrained Skill Check. However, such<br>efforts suffer a – 2 rol l modifi er to refl ect the surgeo n’s reduced<br>experience with such run-of-the-mill medical tasks.<br> For more on how to perform surgery in game play, consult the<br>Healing and Recovery rules in the Basic Combat chapter (pp. 192-<br>195). As a general rule of thumb, the Surgery Skill should not be<br>used on characters who have suff ered less than half of their total<br>number of hit points in damage, or who have sustained any single<br>injury greater than half the character’s BOD score (rounded down,<br>if individual injuries are being tracked).<br> Surgery often takes hours to resolve, and patient recovery can<br>take weeks due to the invasiveness of most surgical procedures.<br> Surgery can also be extremely risky for the patient; any failed<br>Surgery Skill Check can cause greater damage to the character,<br>extending his convalescence or even killing him.<br> Subskills and Specialties: Surgery Skill modifiers can be based<br>on the equipment and facilities at the surgeon’s disposal, the<br>extent of any injuries, and the surgeon’s familiarity with the specific<br>procedure. As with MedTech, Surgery also breaks down into two<br>subskills—General for human patients and Veterinary for animal<br>patients. Players should consider additional specialties for fields<br>of surgical expertise, such as Cardiopulmonary (pertaining to the<br>heart and lungs), Cosmetic (plastic surgery and reconstruction),<br>Gastroenterologic (pertaining to digestive systems), Neurological<br>(pertaining to the brain and nervous systems), Oncological<br>(pertaining to cancer treatment) and Transplants (pertaining<br>to organ replacement and cybernetic implantations). These<br>specialties apply to both subskills.
Surgery/Veterinary;SURGERY<br>Subskills: General, Veterinary<br> The Surgery Skill follows roughly the same rules as the MedTech<br>Skill, but pertains more to cutting open a patient and dealing with<br>serious problems like vital organ damage, cancers and physical<br>reconstruction. A character with the Surgery Skill but no MedTech<br>Skill can perform all of the actions appropriate to MedTech<br>without having to make an untrained Skill Check. However, such<br>efforts suffer a – 2 rol l modifi er to refl ect the surgeo n’s reduced<br>experience with such run-of-the-mill medical tasks.<br> For more on how to perform surgery in game play, consult the<br>Healing and Recovery rules in the Basic Combat chapter (pp. 192-<br>195). As a general rule of thumb, the Surgery Skill should not be<br>used on characters who have suff ered less than half of their total<br>number of hit points in damage, or who have sustained any single<br>injury greater than half the character’s BOD score (rounded down,<br>if individual injuries are being tracked).<br> Surgery often takes hours to resolve, and patient recovery can<br>take weeks due to the invasiveness of most surgical procedures.<br> Surgery can also be extremely risky for the patient; any failed<br>Surgery Skill Check can cause greater damage to the character,<br>extending his convalescence or even killing him.<br> Subskills and Specialties: Surgery Skill modifiers can be based<br>on the equipment and facilities at the surgeon’s disposal, the<br>extent of any injuries, and the surgeon’s familiarity with the specific<br>procedure. As with MedTech, Surgery also breaks down into two<br>subskills—General for human patients and Veterinary for animal<br>patients.

These<br>specialties apply to both subskills.
Survival;SURVIVAL<br>Subskills: By Environment (arctic, desert, forest, ocean,<br>mountain, jungle and so on)<br> The Survival Skill is used to help the character endure the<br>challenges and dangers of a particular natural environment.<br> Though this Skill includes basic knowledge of fl ora and fauna,<br>and the means to identify what can and cannot be eaten, the<br>extreme diversity found on the hundreds of inhabited planets<br>usually prevents someone from being an expert in a particular<br>environment on more than one world. (To refl ect this, a character<br>should tie his Survival Skill to a specific planet.)<br> A character may need to make a Survival Skill Check once per day<br>while in the wild for extended periods. If successful, the character<br>remains healthy and establishes or maintains a food supply. If not,<br>the character may suff er damage from those elements that can<br>infl ict physical harm, or from lingering Fatigue, or even have his<br>Attributes reduced over time. (The gamemaster should determine<br>the specifics of such deterioration based on present conditions,<br>taking into account issues such as hunger, food poisoning, illness<br>and the like; for random animal attacks, the character must rely on<br>other Skills to cope).<br> Subskills: Even if the character does not specialize his Survival<br>Skill to a given world, Survival subskills are restricted to general<br>environment types. Examples include arctic, jungle, tundra and<br>mountain environments, though gamemasters and players may<br>be able to describe other locales worthy of this Skill.
Swimming;SWIMMING<br>Subskills: None<br>The Swimming Skill enables the character to swim, tread<br>water and essentially deal with all-liquid terrain. A character<br>with Swimming Skill generally must make no Skill Checks if he is<br>treading water (swimming in place) or simply moving from one<br>point to another on the surface. Deep dives and maneuvering<br>through tight underwater confi nes may require a Skill Check to<br>resolve. Possession of the Swimming Skill allows the character<br>to use Swimming movement in personal combat as a Simple<br>Action (without it, Swimming is not only an untrained Skill, but a<br>Complex Action as well). In addition, this Skill covers knowledge<br>of diving and SCUBA gear.<br> Swimming Skill Checks (when required) may be modified based<br>on the nature of the liquid in which the character is swimming,<br>how much weight the character is carrying, what weather and<br>current conditions exist, and whether or not the character is<br>using any kind of swimming gear suitable for the job. A successful<br>Swimming Skill Check to enter the water, for example, means that<br>a character successfully slides in and executes a deep dive without<br>wasting breath and motion. Swimming underwater without gear<br>also requires Skill Checks to determine when a character may<br>need to surface. Failure means the character either needs to try<br>again or may begin to drown while still too deep to break the<br>surface. (Drowning is often refl ected by delivering continuous<br>Fatigue damage points to the character’s combat monitor.)
Tactics/Infantry;TACTICS<br>Subskills: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, Space<br>The Tactics Skill focuses on the execution and direction of<br>battles in an immediate combat area, typically one with which<br>the tactical offi cer is directly involved—be it from the cockpit of<br>his own BattleMech, as commander of an infantry squad, or from<br>a nearby HQ vehicle. Concerned with victory conditions and the<br>state of the troops involved in the action, the Tactics Skill aims at<br>winning the current battle more than the campaign of which it<br>may be only a small part.<br> Characters may make Tactics Skill Checks to help identify the<br>overall goals for a current or upcoming battle, and to perceive<br>clues about any potential fl aws in the enemy’s combat tactics.<br>Modifi ers may apply based on a lack of local intelligence or<br>communications, leading to fl awed analyses (and correspondingly<br>bad planning). A successful roll can enable a character to know<br>where a critical fl aw exists in an enemy’s defenses or attack plans,<br>or even sniff out whether an enemy ambush or flanking force<br>might be lying in wait. But while superior Tactics can win wars,<br>gamemasters should never allow a simple roll using this Skill to<br>provide all the answers a fi eld commander may want.<br> As an added benefit, a character’s Tactics Skill may beef up his<br>Initiative in personal or tactical combat if the following conditions<br>are met: a) the character is the team’s commander or tactical officer;<br>b) the team has reliable and uninterrupted communications<br>during the turn; and c) the players agree to using Team Initiative<br>rather than individual Initiative. For every turn where all of these<br>conditions apply and the Tactics Skill user can communicate<br>with his team, the level of this Skill may be applied to the team’s<br>Initiative roll as a bonus.<br> The Tactics Skill has fi ve primary subskills, each focused on a<br>distinct class of modern combat: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, and Space.<br> Infantry: This subskill covers tactics where the primary forces<br>are non-vehicular ground units such as infantry, mounted infantry<br>and battle armor.
Tactics/Land;TACTICS<br>Subskills: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, Space<br>The Tactics Skill focuses on the execution and direction of<br>battles in an immediate combat area, typically one with which<br>the tactical offi cer is directly involved—be it from the cockpit of<br>his own BattleMech, as commander of an infantry squad, or from<br>a nearby HQ vehicle. Concerned with victory conditions and the<br>state of the troops involved in the action, the Tactics Skill aims at<br>winning the current battle more than the campaign of which it<br>may be only a small part.<br> Characters may make Tactics Skill Checks to help identify the<br>overall goals for a current or upcoming battle, and to perceive<br>clues about any potential fl aws in the enemy’s combat tactics.<br>Modifi ers may apply based on a lack of local intelligence or<br>communications, leading to fl awed analyses (and correspondingly<br>bad planning). A successful roll can enable a character to know<br>where a critical fl aw exists in an enemy’s defenses or attack plans,<br>or even sniff out whether an enemy ambush or flanking force<br>might be lying in wait.

For every turn where all of these<br>conditions apply and the Tactics Skill user can communicate<br>with his team, the level of this Skill may be applied to the team’s<br>Initiative roll as a bonus.<br> The Tactics Skill has fi ve primary subskills, each focused on a<br>distinct class of modern combat: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, and Space.<br> Land: This subskill covers tactics where the primary forces are<br>vehicular (though non-vehicle forces may be a component of the<br>battle). It specifi cally covers battles where vehicles and ’Mechs are<br>the dominant factor.
Tactics/Sea;TACTICS<br>Subskills: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, Space<br>The Tactics Skill focuses on the execution and direction of<br>battles in an immediate combat area, typically one with which<br>the tactical offi cer is directly involved—be it from the cockpit of<br>his own BattleMech, as commander of an infantry squad, or from<br>a nearby HQ vehicle. Concerned with victory conditions and the<br>state of the troops involved in the action, the Tactics Skill aims at<br>winning the current battle more than the campaign of which it<br>may be only a small part.<br> Characters may make Tactics Skill Checks to help identify the<br>overall goals for a current or upcoming battle, and to perceive<br>clues about any potential fl aws in the enemy’s combat tactics.<br>Modifi ers may apply based on a lack of local intelligence or<br>communications, leading to fl awed analyses (and correspondingly<br>bad planning).

For every turn where all of these<br>conditions apply and the Tactics Skill user can communicate<br>with his team, the level of this Skill may be applied to the team’s<br>Initiative roll as a bonus.<br> The Tactics Skill has fi ve primary subskills, each focused on a<br>distinct class of modern combat: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, and Space.<br> Sea: This subskill covers tactics where the primary forces are<br>water-based vehicles (though amphibious units, such as SCUBA<br>infantry, may be a component). It especially focuses on surface<br>and submersible naval vessels.
Tactics/Air;TACTICS<br>Subskills: Infantry, Land, Sea, Air, Space<br>The Tactics Skill focuses on the execution and direction of<br>battles in an immediate combat area, typically one with which<br>the tactical offi cer is directly involved—be it from the cockpit of<br>his own BattleMech, as commander of an infantry squad, or from<br>a nearby HQ vehicle.

Given this range,<br>it is not uncommon for this subskill to be further specialized,<br>including small arms and heavy weapons within a given category.<br>Melee weapon types are better served by the Mechanics subskill.
Thrown Weapons/Blades;THROWN WEAPONS<br>Subskills: Blades, Blunt Weapons<br>This skill covers the use of handheld weapons weighted and<br>balanced for throwing—a ranged and often indirect attack in<br>personal combat that includes bladed weapons such as shuriken<br>and darts, blunt objects like rocks, and explosives like grenades<br>and bomb satchels. The Thrown Weapons Skill uses the following<br>subskills in game play:<br> Blades: This subskill covers the use of sharp thrown objects,<br>such as shuriken, throwing daggers and darts. Such weapons are<br>generally balanced for throwing and accurate placement.
Thrown Weapons/Blunt Weapons;THROWN WEAPONS<br>Subskills: Blades, Blunt Weapons<br>This skill covers the use of handheld weapons weighted and<br>balanced for throwing—a ranged and often indirect attack in<br>personal combat that includes bladed weapons such as shuriken<br>and darts, blunt objects like rocks, and explosives like grenades<br>and bomb satchels. The Thrown Weapons Skill uses the following<br>subskills in game play:<br> Blunt Weapons: This subskill covers everything from improvised<br>weapons like rocks and debris to balls and even grenades.
Tracking/Urban;TRACKING<br>Subskills: Urban, Wilds<br>The Tracking Skill enables a character to follow a person or<br>animal based on the scant signs and evidence they leave behind.<br>This Skill is commonly used by scout troops patrolling built-up<br>areas for intruders, or by game hunters tracking wild game for<br>food or sport, but it can also be used to foil hostile trackers by<br>covering one’s traces.<br> A successful Tracking roll can yield clues to where the tracker’s<br>quarry may have gone and how long ago it passed through an<br>area where the tracker is searching—and, if close enough by,<br>can even identify the quarry’s most likely location. Modifiers<br>to a Tracking roll depend on the subject’s size and intelligence,<br>the preponderance of clues it may leave in its wake, and<br>environmental factors. (Tracking humans across a broken<br>tundra with minimal weather is likely to be extremely<br>diffi cult , whil e followin g a wil d elephan t throug h a muddy<br>jungle may be quite a bit easier.)<br> If a character uses his Tracking Skill to thwart enemy trackers,<br>it counts as a Complex Action and reduces the character to<br>one-third of his usual movement rates. On the plus side, it also<br>applies half the character’s Tracking Skill level (rounded up) as<br>a penalty modifi er to the opposing tracker’s Tracking Skill.<br> Tracking has two primary subskills: Urban and Wilds.<br> Urban: This subskill covers pursuing a target through<br>“civilized” areas, and includes the ability to spot physical<br>signs of a target’s passing. Such evidence may be anything<br>from disturbed debris and telltale property damage to quick<br>queries among the locals as to whether they’ve seen anything<br>matching the quarry’s description. In an urban setting, humans<br>are often the game.
Tracking/Wilds;TRACKING<br>Subskills: Urban, Wilds<br>The Tracking Skill enables a character to follow a person or<br>animal based on the scant signs and evidence they leave behind.<br>This Skill is commonly used by scout troops patrolling built-up<br>areas for intruders, or by game hunters tracking wild game for<br>food or sport, but it can also be used to foil hostile trackers by<br>covering one’s traces.<br> A successful Tracking roll can yield clues to where the tracker’s<br>quarry may have gone and how long ago it passed through an<br>area where the tracker is searching—and, if close enough by,<br>can even identify the quarry’s most likely location.

In the wilds, the most common<br>game is non-human.
Training;TRAINING<br>Subskills: None<br>The Training Skill enables a character to share his expertise<br>with other characters. This Skill is particularly valuable, as the<br>further development of any Advanced Skill (SA or CA) requires<br>a trainer. A successful Training Check can impart to the lucky<br>recipients bonus XP toward the addition and improvement of<br>any Skill the trainer has and wishes to pass on (see p. 334).<br> To train another character in a Skill, the trainer must possess<br>the Training Skill (at any level). Furthermore, the Skill that<br>the trainer wishes to teach must also be in the trainer’s own<br>repertoire, and its recipient must be at least one level below<br>the trainer in expertise to benefi t from the trainer’s instruction.<br> If all of these criteria are met, the training character can make<br>a Training Skill Check at end of a training cycle (which can<br>run a week or more, depending on conditions), applying the<br>trainee’s INT Linked Attribute modifi er to the roll result, in<br>addition to all other applicable modifi ers (see Training, p. 334).<br> If the Training Check is successful, the trainer awards 1 XP<br>point (2, if the Skill is Basic) to the trainee, multiplied by the<br>Training Skill Check’s Margin of Success. These XPs are applied<br>directly to the Skill the trainer is teaching the trainee, and<br>are in turn combined with any XP the trainee has already<br>invested in advancing the Skill to its next level. (Thus, training<br>effectively reduces the Skill’s cost). If the Training roll fails, the<br>trainer must repeat the week’s instruction and try again. While<br>Training Skill Checks are optional for Basic (SB or CB) Skills,<br>Advanced (SA or CA) Skills can only be raised after a successful<br>Training Skill Check (even if the trainee already has enough XP<br>invested in the Skill to advance).<br> The maximum level a Skill<br>can be raised to with the Training<br>Skill is equal to the level the trainer has in the<br>Skill being taught, or the Trainer’s Training Skill<br>level, whichever is lower. For example, if a trainer<br>with a Technician Skill level of 5 and a Training Skill<br>level of 3 were to instruct a student in the use of the<br>Technician Skill, the highest level the trainer can provide<br>XPs for would be 3; even though his practical knowledge is<br>more developed, his ability to pass that information along is<br>hindered by his lower Training Skill level.
Zero-G Operations;ZERO-G OPERATIONS<br>Subskills: None<br>The ability to function eff ectively in micro-gravity is<br>the primary purpose for the Zero-G Operations Skill. Skill<br>Checks are not generally required for Zero-G Operations,<br>but each level of this Skill the character possesses will<br>reduce the penalties a character may suff er for operating<br>in low or zero gravity (gravity ratings under 1.0 G; see High/<br>Low Gravity under Special Conditions, p. 237) by 1 point (to<br>a minimum modifi er of 0). This penalty reduction does not<br>apply to inertia-based modifi ers, as they are aff ected by the<br>G-Tolerance Trait (see p. 118).<br> A character may make a Zero-G Operations Skill Check<br>to resist additional side eff ects from micro-gravity at the<br>gamemaster’s discretion, such as knockdown eff ects from<br>recoil when using kinetic weapons in zero gravity. In such<br>cases, a successful Zero-G Operations Skill Check allows the<br>character to ignore those eff ects. The Zero-G Operations<br>Skill may also be used in place of Acrobatics/Free-Fall, but<br>only as long as the character is operating in micro-gravity<br>or zero gravity.
