Alternate ID;ALTERNATE ID [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Alternate ID Trait has a well-established<br>alias that he or she can call upon in dire circumstances (such<br>as having a price on one’s head from Tharkad to Solaris). More<br>than a mere name, this alias comes with credentials, resources<br>and even an alternate appearance. A character may possess<br>more than one Alternate ID, with each refl ecting a different<br>persona, but if the character has any Identity-dependent<br>Traits, those Traits must be assigned to one of the character’s<br>identities. Identity-dependent Traits are: Alternate ID, Attractive,<br>Bloodmark, Connections, Dark Secret, Dependents, Equipped, In<br>For Life, Property, Rank, Reputation, Vehicle and Wealth. Multiple<br>or Flexible-value Traits may be broken up among the character’s<br>various Identities, but the player should take care to track which<br>identity has which Traits, as tapping the resources of one alias<br>while under another can expose the character to anyone who<br>might dig too deeply into his past.<br>Etc... See p.108
Ambidextrous;AMBIDEXTROUS [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Ambidextrous Trait can use both hands<br>equally well (a character without this Trait must select a primary<br>and an “off ” hand during character generation). Ambidextrous<br>characters ignore the off -hand modifier in gameplay and in<br>combat. Though this Trait allows the character to carry and use<br>a weapon equally well with either hand in combat, it does not<br>confer the ability to exceed the normal number of actions allowed<br>in a combat turn.
Animal Empathy;ANIMAL EMPATHY [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Animal Empathy Trait has a natural gift<br>with creatures, even those he may ordinarily despise. In game<br>play, Animal Empathy imposes a +2 modifi er to all Skill Checks<br>involving animals, such as Animal Handling, Riding and so forth.<br>This eff ect also halves the modifiers (rounding down ) for a<br>creature’s Shy or Aggressive Traits whenever said creature must<br>make a Fight or Flight Check in the character’s presence (see<br>Creatures, p. 238). Creatures without the Aggressive Trait behave<br>as if they have the Shy Trait while in the character’s presence, while<br>creatures with the Shy Trait behave as if Tamed instead. If combat<br>ensues, creatures will attack characters with this Trait last—unless<br>the animal empathic character directly attacks the creature first.<br> The Animal Antipathy Trait opposes the Animal Empathy Trait.<br>If a character with Animal Empathy receives or purchases Animal<br>Antipathy (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Animal Antipathy;ANIMAL ANTIPATHY [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Animal Antipathy Trait manages to bring<br>out the worst in all creatures, great and small. Whether or not the<br>character feels the same way, something about the character<br>makes animals react far more negatively to his presence than<br>they would otherwise. In game play, Animal Antipathy imposes<br>a –2 modifi er to all Skill Checks involving animals, such as<br>Animal Handling, Riding and so forth. This eff ect also doubles<br>the modifi ers for a creature’s Shy or Aggressive Traits whenever<br>said creature must make a Fight or Flight Check in the character’s<br>presence (see Creatures, p. 238). Any creature with the Aggressive<br>Trait will also behave as if it has the Blood Rage Trait while in the<br>character’s presence. If combat ensues, a creature so enraged will<br>attack the nearest character with this Trait first.<br>The Animal Empathy Trait opposes the Animal Antipathy Trait.<br> If a character with Animal Antipathy receives or purchases Animal<br>Empathy (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Attractive;ATTRACTIVE [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Attractive Trait has a natural beauty that<br>makes the character more appealing to those attracted to the<br>character’s gender. Characters with this Trait receive a +2 modifier<br>to Skill and Attribute Checks where the character’s CHA Attribute<br>is a factor, if the subject of the roll is attracted to the character’s<br>gender. If the subject is not normally attracted to the character’s<br>gender, a +1 modifier applies, to reflect the disarming charm<br>produced by the character’s comeliness. The Unattractive Trait opposes<br>the Attractive Trait. If a character with Attractive receives or<br>purchases Unattractive (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other<br>out unless the Attractive Trait is specifically assigned to one of<br>the character’s aliases (in which case, Attractive is treated as<br>an identity-dependent Trait; see Alternate ID, p. 108).
Bloodmark;BLOODMARK [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–5 to –1 TP]<br>A character with the Bloodmark Trait has a price on his head<br>and is being actively hunted by bounty hunters looking to collect.<br>The reason for this bounty may stem from a real transgression<br>on the character’s part, a complete fabrication by an enemy<br>with resources and a grudge, or a case of mistaken identity.<br> Bloodmarks are typically tied to one (or more) of the character’s<br>Enemies (see the Enemies Trait, p. 113), but a character who has<br>this Trait in the absence of an Enemy may simply be unaware of<br>who has targeted them in such a fashion.<br> Etc... p.109
Citizenship;CITIZENSHIP/TRUEBORN [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+2 TP]<br>In some Inner Sphere states (and among all the Clans),<br>individual rights and privileges are more severely restricted<br>than they are in most other societies. In the Inner Sphere,<br>citizenship is the term most often used to identify those<br>members of society permitted to own land, vote, gain access<br>to higher education, or even follow certain careers. Among the<br>Clans, this stratifi cation is apparent in the divide between those<br>born of the iron wombs—so-called trueborns—and those<br>born through more conventional methods (“freeborns”).<br> Inner Sphere (Citizenship)<br>An Inner Sphere character that possesses the Citizenship<br>Trait has won the right to be called a citizen in one of the<br>more restrictive realms. Not all realms require this Trait; those<br>Affiliations that have restrictive citizenship requirements are<br>identifi ed in the character creation chapter (see pp. 48-93).<br>Citizenship Traits are identity-based, and so must be<br>assigned to one of the character’s aliases if the character has<br>an Alternate ID (see Alternate ID, p. 108). A character that has<br>multiple Citizenship Traits must distribute them among all<br>aliases as appropriate, with a maximum of one Citizenship<br>Trait per alias.
Citizenship;CITIZENSHIP/TRUEBORN [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+2 TP]<br>In some Inner Sphere states (and among all the Clans),<br>individual rights and privileges are more severely restricted<br>than they are in most other societies. In the Inner Sphere,<br>citizenship is the term most often used to identify those<br>members of society permitted to own land, vote, gain access<br>to higher education, or even follow certain careers. Among the<br>Clans, this stratifi cation is apparent in the divide between those<br>born of the iron wombs—so-called trueborns—and those<br>born through more conventional methods (“freeborns”).<br> Clan Characters (Trueborn)<br>Among the Clans, only those individuals spawned in the iron<br>wombs can claim to be known as trueborns. Only a trueborn<br>Clan character is eligible to receive a Bloodname Trait (the<br>Clan equivalent of Title; see p. 126), and with it, a voice in Clan<br>politics. Trueborn Clansmen must select a Phenotype Trait as<br>well (see p. 121), and begin life as part of the Warrior Caste<br>(through trueborns can still wash out of training or leave the<br>Warrior Caste through other means).<br> The Trueborn Trait refl ects a birth status in the Clans. It<br>cannot be faked, but it can be concealed to some extent if the<br>character takes on any alternate identities. A Clan character<br>with a Trueborn Trait and one or more Alternate ID Traits can<br>assign the Trueborn Trait to only one of these identities, but<br>that identity must be the character’s primary identity (the one<br>he or she was actually born to). Bloodnames do not transfer<br>between aliases.
Combat Paralysis;COMBAT PARALYSIS [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–4 TP]<br>A character with Combat Paralysis tends to freeze up in stressful<br>situations, especially combat. In game play, characters with this<br>Trait roll Initiative using the worst two dice of 3D6. Furthermore,<br>a character a? icted with Combat Paralysis may not seize the<br>initiative, and must therefore act only during his own Action Phase.<br> In Tactical Combat, this Trait has no eff ect unless the character is<br>in command of a force, or is separated from his force commander<br>under the optional Out-of-Contact rule (see p. 204).<br> In stressful situations outside of combat where quick reactions<br>are vital, the gamemaster may require a character with Combat<br>Paralysis to make a successful WIL Attribute Check to act in a<br>timely manner. Failure on this roll means the character delays for<br>one turn (5 seconds) before acting.<br> The Combat Sense Trait opposes the Combat Paralysis Trait. If<br>a character with Combat Paralysis receives or purchases Combat<br>Sense (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Combat Sense;COMBAT SENSE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+4 TP]<br>A character with Combat Sense is in his<br>element during stressful situations, especially<br>combat. In game play, characters with this Trait<br>roll Initiative using the best two dice of 3D6<br>(as if Initiative itself were a Natural Aptitude),<br>and reduce the combat modifi er for Stun or<br>Surprise to +1 (from +2). In Tactical Combat,<br>this Trait has no eff ect unless the character is<br>in command of a force, or is separated from<br>his force commander under the optional Out-<br>of-Contact rule (see p. 204).<br> In stressful situations outside of<br>combat where quick reactions are vital,<br>the gamemaster may also apply a +1 roll<br>modifi er to any Action Check the character<br>performs where stress or fear are a factor<br>(such as resisting the intimidation eff ects of a<br>creature’s Terror Trait, or disarming a bomb as<br>its timer races through its last 15 seconds).<br> The Combat Paralysis Trait opposes the<br>Combat Sense Trait. If a character with<br>Combat Sense receives or purchases Combat<br>Paralysis (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each<br>other out.
Compulsion;COMPULSION [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–5 to –1 TP]<br>A character with a Compulsion Trait has an irrational tendency<br>toward some kind of negative behavior, ranging from a minor quirk<br>like fear of heights or a superstition, to a more serious addiction<br>to drugs or alcohol. In more extreme cases, a compulsion can take<br>the form of madness, where stress can trigger a dramatic and<br>emotional episode.<br> The level of a Compulsion Trait determines how severely<br>detrimental it is to the character’s behavior in game play, but player<br>and gamemaster should thoroughly discuss the cause and nature<br>of each compulsion beforehand to get a feel for what may or may<br>not set it off . The Compulsion Trait Table below provides basic rules<br>and examples of how severely this Trait will aff ect a character. Etc... See p.110
Connections;CONNECTIONS [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +10 TP]<br>A character with the Connections Trait can potentially call<br>upon the aid of contacts and resources, given enough time<br>and a credible means to do so. This Trait’s TP score provides<br>a guide for how powerful such connections are, and how<br>easy it is for a character who has them to fi nd contacts at any<br>given time—as well as how often a character may be able to<br>tap his connections.<br> The Connections Trait can be a powerful tool in the hands<br>of a crafty player character, so gamemasters must balance the<br>character’s process for fi nding and using this Trait against the<br>character’s situation and demands. For example, a character<br>stationed on a depopulated outpost in the Periphery, without<br>benefi t of a working HPG, will be unable to call on his<br>connections to deliver him fi ne caviar from Tharkad before it<br>spoils. The gamemaster should also determine whether local<br>connections might ask for something in exchange for their<br>services (and what that might be). 
Custom Vehicle;CUSTOM VEHICLE [VEHICLE]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +6 TP]<br>A Custom Vehicle Trait applies to only one of the character’s<br>vehicles (if any), and varies with the vehicle’s technological<br>sophistication and design uniqueness. The Custom Vehicle<br>Trait applies solely to battle armor, ProtoMechs, BattleMechs,<br>IndustrialMechs, Combat Vehicles, Conventional Fighters<br>and Aerospace Fighters. Without a Custom Vehicle Trait, the<br>character’s starting vehicle (if any) is determined randomly using<br>the appropriate Affi liation column and the Random Assignment<br>Tables (see Vehicle Level, p. 128).<br> The Custom Vehicle Trait Table identifi es how the TP score<br>of this Trait aff ects the character’s available selections from<br>the appropriate vehicle type. The Random Assignment Tables<br>referenced here are located on pp. 130-135 and refl ect a sampling<br>of “stock” units in the present 3075 era by general Affiliations.<br> Gamemasters interested in reflecting greater depth in their<br>games may wish to research other vehicle designs featured in the<br>various Technical Readouts and assign vehicles by the alternate<br>non-table method noted in the Custom Vehicle Trait Table. A Clan<br>player with no Custom Vehicle Trait will receive a Random Front-<br>Line unit assignment if trueborn, or Second-Line if freeborn.
Dark Secret;DARK SECRET [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–1 to –5 TP]<br>A character with the Dark Secret Trait has a major<br>skeleton in his closet—a past deed, relationship or personal<br>truth he’d rather not see brought to light. The TP score for<br>this Trait indicates just how major this secret is, with a –1 TP<br>score refl ecting a fairly minor (but still character-damaging)<br>secret like lying about one’s political views or academic<br>credentials on an application, while a –5 TP secret reflects<br>a major act of treachery or a morally reprehensible crime. If<br>the secret is ever revealed, the Dark Secret Trait will become<br>a Reputation Trait of equivalent TP score for the character,<br>and will also reduce any Connections the character has by<br>half the Trait’s negative TP score (round up). For example,<br>a –3 TP Dark Secret, once revealed, reduces the character’s<br>Reputation by 3 TP and his Connections by 2 TP (3 ? 2 =<br>1.5, rounded up to 2). At the gamemaster’s discretion,<br>a particularly devastating Dark Secret can even lead to<br>additional eff ects, such as imprisonment, persecution and<br>Bloodmark Traits. A character with a Dark Secret is likely to do<br>anything in his power to ensure that the secret remains hidden<br>forever.Etc.. See p.112
Dependent;DEPENDENTS [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–1 to –2 TP]<br>A character with a Dependent Trait has a loved one or family<br>member (usually a spouse or children) who is very important<br>or close to the character—and who cannot defend against<br>being taken captive or threatened by potential enemies. The<br>level of this Trait refl ects the dependent’s vulnerability; a –1 TP<br>Dependent might be an adult who is mildly disabled or lacks<br>self-defense Skills, while a –2 TP Dependent refl ects a juvenile<br>or severely handicapped individual.<br> A character whose dependent is threatened (and who<br>knows of the threat) cannot function normally until that<br>dependent is out of harm’s way. To refl ect this in game play,<br>treat the eff ects of a threatened dependent as equivalent to a<br>triggered Compulsion Trait of equal TP score (see Compulsion,<br>p. 110). If multiple dependents are threatened, stack any roll<br>modifi ers applied to a maximum of –3.<br> Dependent Traits are identity-based and must be assigned<br>to one of the character’s aliases if the character has an<br>Alternate ID (see Alternate ID, p. 108). However, unlike other<br>identity-dependent character Traits, the Trait eff ects noted<br>above can apply to a character regardless of his alias (though<br>an additional +1 roll modifi er applies if the threatened<br>dependents are not associated with the character’s currently<br>active alias, refl ecting the distance the character feels from his<br>dependents when using his alternate persona).
Design Quirk;DESIGN QUIRK [VEHICLE]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Multiple [–5 to +5 TP]<br>The Design Quirk Trait applies to a specific vehicle the<br>character owns, or is assigned to, rather than to the character.<br>This Trait describes extra features or fl aws that a vehicle has<br>beyond its combat statistics. These design quirks, listed in<br>the Design Quirks Trait Table (pp. 114-115), refer primarily<br>to those described on pp. 193-199 of Strategic Operations.<br>Gamemasters without access to that rulebook who wish to<br>use this Trait, or who wish to apply similar quirks to unlisted<br>units such as ProtoMechs, may instead devise an appropriate<br>feature or fl aw in the character’s vehicle based on the TP score<br>for this Trait. Positive or negative TPs of 1 or 2 reflect fairly<br>minor or limited-eff ect quirks such as sporadic sensor glitches<br>(negative TP) or small piloting bonuses that apply only in<br>certain conditions (positive TP), and so forth. TPs in the 3 to 5<br>range refl ect increasingly significant quirks like faulty power<br>systems (negative) and enhanced targeting (positive).<br>Etc... See p.113
Enemy;ENEMY [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–1 to –10 TP]<br>A character with an Enemy Trait has somehow attracted the<br>ire of a person or organization that has the infl uence and the<br>will to make the character’s life a living hell. Enemies of this<br>type are far more powerful than a mere childhood or academic<br>rival, though they may start out as such. To be worthy of the<br>Enemy Trait, an enemy must have a level of infl uence similar to<br>a character’s connections, but working against the character<br>rather than for him. The Trait’s TP score indicates the level of<br>the enemy’s power and influence.<br>Etc... See p.113
Except Attribute;EXCEPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Exceptional Attribute Trait may have an<br>Attribute value that is 1 point above the normal maximum for that<br>phenotype (see Character Maximums in the character creation<br>rules, p. 85). This Trait, however, does not actually raise the selected<br>Attribute itself or provide the Attribute at its new maximum value:<br>experience points must still be spent to accomplish that (during<br>character creation or game play).<br> Though Exceptional Attribute may be purchased multiple<br>times, only one Exceptional Attribute Trait may be applied per<br>Attribute.
Equipped;EQUIPPED [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Multiple [–1 to +8 TP]<br> A character with the Equipped Trait has less (or more) restricted<br>access to certain equipment during character creation. Though this<br>Trait is primarily used during character creation, the gamemaster<br>may use this level of equipment access throughout game play<br>as long as the character also has a Connections Trait of equal<br>score. This option allows the character to access the level of gear<br>represented by this Trait in game play, by identifying the related<br>connections as the character’s access to an exclusive supplier.<br> The Equipped Table outlines the character’s level of equipment<br>access based on the Trait’s TP score, refl ecting the maximum<br>equipment ratings to which a character may have access when<br>purchasing equipment in terms of Tech Level, Availability and<br>Legality (see Equipment, starting on p. 254, for more information<br>on these codes).<br> The Equipped Trait cannot be used to obtain items covered<br>by the Vehicle Trait (see p. 128). However, personal vehicles and<br>support vehicles may be obtained through this Trait.<br> Equipped Traits are identity-based and must be assigned to<br>one of the character’s aliases if the character has an Alternate<br>ID (see Alternate ID, p. 108). A character with multiple Equipped<br>Traits must distribute them among all aliases as appropriate, with<br>no more than one Equipped Trait per alias.
Extra Income;EXTRA INCOME [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Multiple [–10 to +10 TP]<br> A character with the Extra Income Trait receives (or pays<br>out) money on a monthly basis due to a stipend,<br>low-risk investment or personal debt beyond his<br>current employment. How much money comes in (or goes out)<br>on a monthly basis (always assessed at the start of<br>the month) depends on this Trait’s TP score as<br>defined in the Extra Income Trait Table below. Positive-TP<br>Extra Income Traits reflect a regular income, while<br>negative-TP Extra Income Traits refl ect an ongoing debt.<br> The funds are covered electronically, drawing off the<br>character’s savings regardless of his physical location.<br>However, before game play begins, the gamemaster and the<br>player of a character with Extra Income must define all<br>of the character’s Extra Income Traits, to determine what<br>cause and conditions maintain this flow of money. If<br>the Extra Income is a stipend, such funds may come with<br>conditions the character must uphold to continue receiving<br>them. In the case of a debt, a certain total balance may<br>remain outstanding (for which the debt may only be<br>covering the interest).<br>Etc...See p.117
Fast Learner;FAST LEARNER [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+3 TP]<br>A character with the Fast Learner Trait can pick up and<br>improve Skills faster than many other characters of<br>equal intelligence. Fast Learner reduces the experience<br>cost for Skills by 10 percent, both during character<br>generation (see p. 85) and Skill advancement (see p. 333).<br> The Slow Learner Trait opposes the Fast Learner Trait.<br>If a character with Fast Learner receives or purchases<br>Slow Learner (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each<br>other out.
Fit;FIT [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Fit Trait—from either a blessed<br>metabolism or a healthy lifestyle of proper diet and<br>exercise—has excellent endurance and physical prowess<br>beyond the norm for a typical character with<br>equivalent Attributes. This Trait confers a +1 roll<br>modifier to any Attribute Check against the<br>character’s BOD or STR scores (but not to Skill<br>Checks involving those as Linked Attributes). The Fit<br>Trait also halves the character’s Fatigue (rounding<br>down) from strenuous activity such as running,<br>sprinting or lifting heavy objects (see Fatigue,<br>p. 189). Finally, characters with this Trait recover<br>an additional 2 points of Fatigue per turn.<br> The Handicap Trait (at any level) opposes the Fit<br>Trait, but unlike most Traits, Fit and Handicap do<br>not cancel each other out in their entirety.<br> Instead, the character must off set any Handicaps by<br>purchasing enough “additional” Fit Traits to balance<br>the negative TP score of all Handicaps (in essence<br>using Fit’s positive TPs to cancel out the negative<br>TPs of Handicap). Only after all such Handicaps are<br>“bought off ” in this fashion can the character<br>receive a Fit Trait (so long as the Fit Trait attains<br>its full TP score of +2). If any of the character’s<br>Handicaps are described as genetic, however, no<br>amount of Fit Trait points will cancel out the<br>disorder, and the character can never receive the<br>Fit Trait.
G-Tolerance;G-TOLERANCE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+1 TP]<br>A character with the G-Tolerance Trait is less aff ected by the<br>stresses of variable gravity conditions, including zero-gravity<br>operations and high-gravity maneuvers. Characters with this<br>Trait suff er half the roll modifi er s applie d fro m non-standard<br>gravity conditions and acceleration (see Planetary Conditions<br>under Special Case Rules, p. 230), as well as half the Fatigue from<br>such conditions (see Fatigue under Personal Combat, p. 189).<br> G-Tolerant aerospace pilots also apply a +1 modifi er to Piloting<br>Skill Rolls when executing high-G maneuvers (such as those<br>described on p. 78 of Total Warfare), and receive a +1 roll modifier<br>to any RFL Attribute Checks made to resist the eff ects of sudden<br>inertia (such as while onboard a DropShip attempting a sudden<br>maneuver or acceleration).
Glass Jaw;GLASS JAW [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–3 TP]<br>A character with the Glass Jaw Trait is far more susceptible<br>to injury than his BOD Attribute may indicate. When sustaining<br>injury of any kind, a character with Glass Jaw multiplies any<br>personal damage sustained by 1.5 (rounding up), and multiplies<br>any Fatigue suff ered from combat by 2.<br> The Toughness Trait opposes the Glass Jaw Trait. If a character<br>with Glass Jaw receives or purchases Toughness (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out.
Good Hearing;GOOD HEARING [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Good Hearing Trait has better-than-average<br>hearing. This Trait applies a +1 roll modifi er to any Perception Skill<br>Checks where hearing is a factor, but has no impact on combat<br>action rolls.<br> The Poor Hearing Trait (at any level) opposes the Good Hearing<br>Trait. If a character with Good Hearing receives or purchases Poor<br>Hearing (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Good Vision;GOOD VISION [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Opposed [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Good Vision Trait has better-than-average<br>visual acuity. This Trait applies a +1 roll modifi er to any Perception<br>Skill Checks where vision is a factor, but has no impact on combat<br>action rolls.<br> The Poor Vision Trait (at any level) opposes the Good Vision<br>Trait. If a character with Good Vision receives or purchases Poor<br>Vision (or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Gregarious;GREGARIOUS [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Gregarious Trait has a knack for dealing<br>with people beyond what his normal CHA Attribute might indicate.<br>This Trait applies a +1 roll modifi er to any Skill Checks where social<br>interaction is a factor (at the gamemaster’s discretion).<br>The Introvert Trait opposes the Gregarious Trait. If a character<br>with Gregarious receives or purchases Introvert (or vice versa), the<br>Traits cancel each other out.
Gremlins;GREMLINS [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–3 TP]<br>A character with the Gremlins Trait seems to be incredibly<br>bad with machines, often to the point where anything more<br>sophisticated than a pencil may inexplicably break down or fail<br>on them at a crucial moment.<br> A character with this Trait is so bad with machines that even<br>his attempts to understand technological systems seem to bog<br>down on the intellectual level, resulting in a 10 percent increase<br>to the XP costs for raising or purchasing any Technician Skill. In<br>addition, characters with this Trait receive a –1 roll modifier for<br>using any equipment with a Tech Rating of B or higher, and suffer<br>a fumble result when using any such equipment on a natural roll<br>of 2 or 3. On a natural roll of 2, in fact, the equipment undergoes<br>a breakdown (determined by the gamemaster); weapons that<br>normally fail on such rolls get jammed or fused, requiring repairs<br>before they may be used again.<br> The Tech Empathy Trait opposes the Gremlins Trait. If a character<br>with Gremlins receives or purchases Tech Empathy (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out.
Handicap;HANDICAP [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple, Opposed [–5 to –1 TP]<br>A character with the Handicap Trait has some kind of<br>physical or mental impairment that isn’t covered by other<br>Traits (specifi cally, Traits such as Compulsion, Glass Jaw, Lost<br>Limb, Poor Vision, Poor Hearing, Slow Learner, Thin Skinned or<br>Transit Disorientation Syndrome). The TP score for a Handicap<br>determines how detrimental it is to the character’s behavior<br>and capabilities in game play, but the cause and nature of each<br>Handicap should be thoroughly discussed between player<br>and gamemaster beforehand to get a feel for how extensive<br>and limiting it is.<br> Handicaps with a –1 or –2 TP score, for example, reflect<br>minor a? ictions such as allergies or a reduced endurance for<br>strenuous activity, while Handicaps with a –4 or –5 TP score<br>may refl ect far more extensive disabilities, like a chronic and<br>mobility-robbing disorder that requires constant medical care<br>to keep in check. The Handicap Trait Table below provides<br>basic rules and examples of how severely this Trait may affect<br>a character, but gamemasters and players should agree to the<br>overall eff ects before play begins, and may add more specific<br>limitations as well.
Illiterate;ILLITERATE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Illiterate Trait cannot read, despite<br>his level of Language Skills. This may stem from a lack of<br>proper schooling or a mild mental handicap that impairs his<br>ability to easily comprehend the written word. Characters<br>with this Trait treat all Skills where INT is a Linked Attribute<br>as an untrained Skill in game play, but only if some form<br>of reading is required to complete the action (at the<br>gamemaster’s discretion). Illiterate characters who also lack<br>the Skill in question still determine the action’s TN as normal,<br>but can only resolve it by rolling 3D6 and using the lowest<br>two dice results to complete the action. Furthermore, when<br>purchasing or improving Skills that rely on INT as a Linked<br>Attribute, or which have an Advanced training requirement<br>(CA or SA Skills), the Illiterate Trait adds 10 percent to the<br>Skill’s XP cost (round up).<br> The Illiterate Trait is not opposed by another Trait, but instead<br>is opposed by any Language Skill with a level of 4 or better. If a<br>character with Illiterate receives or improves a Language Skill to<br>level 4 or more, the Illiterate Trait is cancelled out.
Implant/Prosthetic;IMPLANT/PROSTHETIC [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +6 TP]<br>A character with the Implant/Prosthetic Trait has lost a limb <br>or organ, but has managed to secure a replacement before the<br>start of game play. This Trait allows the character to reduce the<br>debilitating eff ects of a Lost Limb, Poor Hearing, or Poor Vision<br>Trait, but only as well as the Implant/Prosthetic allows (as<br>indicated in the Implant/Prosthetic Trait Table). Furthermore,<br>because most prosthetics are mere replacements for the real<br>thing, and may be unplugged or damaged, should any damage<br>befall the character and aff ect these replacements, the character’s<br>healing process will require both medical and technical aid.<br>Etc.. See p.119
Impatient;IMPATIENT [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Impatient Trait suff ers from a compulsive<br>inability to wait, even when it might be in the character’s best<br>interests. In game play, characters with this Trait apply a –1<br>modifi er to all rolls for Skill and Attribute Checks that require a<br>signifi cant amount of time and focus (such as any Skill or action<br>classifi ed as Complex). In addition, the character may only<br>accumulate a maximum +2 roll modifi er for Careful Aim, and may<br>gain no modifi ers for taking extra time on complex tasks.<br> The Patient Trait opposes the Impatient Trait. If a character<br>with Impatient receives or purchases Patient (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out.
In For Life;IN FOR LIFE [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–3 TP]<br>A character with the In For Life Trait is (or was) a member of<br>a large and secretive organization, or is bound by oath, personal<br>honor or some other intangible means to the will of another<br>individual or group. This obligation may stem from any number<br>of sources, so it is important for the player and the gamemaster to<br>coordinate on the Trait’s origins and nature, as they may warrant<br>the creation of suitable non-player characters to whom the<br>character is beholden. Personal life debts may be tied to one (or<br>more) of the character’s connections (see the Connections Trait,<br>p. 111), for example, while an organization the character feels<br>compelled to obey might actually be represented by an enemy<br>persona (see the Enemy Trait, p. 113).<br>a character’s failure to uphold such an obligation could<br>transform the “master” into an enemy, and could even result in<br>a Bloodmark (see Bloodmark Trait, p. 109) against the character<br>if the “master” has the resources and inclination to do so.<br> In For Life Traits are identity-based and must be assigned to<br>one of the character’s aliases if the character has an Alternate<br>ID (see Alternate ID, p. 108). A character with multiple In For Life<br>Traits must distribute them among all aliases as appropriate.
Introvert;INTROVERT [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Introvert Trait has difficulties dealing with<br>people beyond what his normal CHA Attribute might indicate,<br>because of innate shyness or some other social ineptitude. This<br>Trait applies a –1 roll modifi er to any Skill Checks where social<br>interaction is a factor (at the gamemaster’s discretion).<br> The Gregarious Trait opposes the Introvert Trait. If a character<br>with Introvert receives or purchases Gregarious (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out.
Lost Limb;LOST LIMB [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Multiple [–5 to –1 TP]<br>A character with a Lost Limb Trait has lost all of—or a<br>signifi cant portion of—one of his limbs through a birth defect<br>or an injury. The TP value of this Trait varies with the extent of<br>the damage, with a –1 or –2 TP Lost Limb refl ecting missing<br>fi ngers or toes, while a –3 to –4 Lost Limb refl ects a missing<br>foot or hand, and a –5 TP Lost Limb refl ects a missing leg or<br>arm. The Lost Limb Table outlines the game play eff ects of<br>these missing limbs.<br> A character may possess multiple Lost Limbs. However, any<br>hand that suff ers the loss of five fingers should be treated as<br>a missing hand.<br> The Implants/Prosthetics Trait technically opposes the Lost<br>Limb Trait. However, as most prosthetics are easily removable<br>at any time, a Lost Limb Trait is not truly cancelled out by a<br>Prosthetic Trait of equivalent type, unless the prosthetic<br>is classifi ed as a Type 6 (Cloned Replacement Limb) or is<br>otherwise permanent (such as a myomer implant).
Natural Aptitude;NATURAL APTITUDE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+3 or +5 TP]<br>A character with the Natural Aptitude Trait has an affinity for<br>a particular Skill (or, when applicable, a particular Subskill) that<br>goes beyond mere training. Though a character may possess<br>multiple Natural Aptitude Traits, the number of these may not<br>exceed the character’s INT Attribute. The TP score for this Trait<br>depends on the Skill’s complexity, with a +3 TP Natural Aptitude<br>applying to non-Tiered Basic (CB or SB) Skills, and +5 TP Natural<br>Aptitude applying to Advanced (CA or SA) and/or Tiered Skills.<br> In game play, the Skill Check for any Natural Aptitude Skill<br>in which the character has any levels (including Level 0) are<br>rolled using the best two dice of 3D6, rather than a normal<br>2D6. This same best-of-three rule applies to untrained Skill<br>Checks as well.
Pain Resistance;PAIN RESISTANCE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+3 TP]<br>A character with the Pain Resistance Trait has an exceptional<br>ability to ignore more pain than others. While this Trait does<br>not reduce the damage infl icted against the character, it does<br>reduce all Injury modifi ers (to Action Checks and movement<br>eff ects) by 1 point (to a minimum of 0), and allows characters<br>to ignore the Stun eff ect for any injuries sustained as long as<br>the character has sustained less than his BOD score in standard<br>damage, including those from Fatigue damage points.
Patient;PATIENT [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Patient Trait has better focus and self-<br>control, even in high-pressure situations that might force others<br>to haste. In game play, characters with this Trait apply a +1<br>modifi er to all rolls for Skill and Attribute Checks that require a<br>signifi cant amount of time and focus (such as any Skill or action<br>classifi ed as Complex). In addition, the character may accumulate<br>a maximum +4 roll modifi er for Careful Aim, and may double<br>any positive modifi ers for taking extra time on complex tasks,<br>refl ecting the character’s focus and perseverance.<br> The Impatient Trait opposes the Patient Trait. If a character<br>with Patient receives or purchases Impatient (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out.
Phenotype;PHENOTYPE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Neutral, Restricted [0 TP]<br>Technically, all characters receive a phenotype upon<br>creation, but unless the character in question is a Clan<br>trueborn, the only option available in A Time of War is defined<br>simply as “normal human”. Trueborn Clansmen, however, have<br>been eugenically bred toward other phenotypes as well,<br>and must select the Aerospace, Elemental or MechWarrior<br>phenotypes for their characters. This Phenotype Trait has no<br>TP score, but all characters must possess one and only one<br>phenotype. If a character has no Phenotype Trait assigned, he<br>or she is presumed to be a normal human.<br> The Phenotype Trait Table identifi es the properties of<br>each phenotype. Each phenotype provides free modifiers to<br>the character’s base Attributes, which are applied after the<br>character has spent XP on these Attributes, but which may not<br>exceed the listed Attribute maximums (shown in parentheses)<br>for that phenotype. For example, a trueborn Elemental<br>receives an additional +2 Attribute points in Strength, but<br>cannot exceed STR 9 (10 with an Exceptional Attribute), even<br>with these bonus points. Additional Bonus Traits are provided<br>as well (if any), which cost the character no XPs when taken<br>with the phenotype.<br>Etc... See p.121
Poison Resistance;POISON RESISTANCE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+2 TP]<br>A character with the Poison Resistance Trait is blessed with a<br>metabolism that is particularly resistant to poisons and toxins,<br>including alcohol, narcotics and other chemicals. This Trait applies<br>a +2 modifi er to all Attribute Checks made to resist the effects of<br>poisons, drugs and alcohol.
Poor Hearing;POOR HEARING [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]:Negative, Opposed [–5 to –1 TP]<br> A character with the Poor Hearing Trait suffers from<br>hearing loss due to a birth defect or later injury.<br>The severity of this condition varies with the Trait’s<br>TP score; a –1 TP Poor Hearing Trait represents minor<br>hearing loss, while a –5 TP Poor Hearing translates<br>to complete deafness (in both ears). In game terms,<br>the TP score for this Trait is applied as a roll<br>modifier to any hearing-based Action Checks. The<br>character also suff ers a personal combat Initiative<br>roll modifier equal to half the Trait’s score (rounding<br>down), refl ecting his difficulty in picking up vital<br>cues in the midst of personal combat.<br> Etc...See p.122
Poor Vision;POOR VISION [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–9 to –2 TP]<br>A character with the Poor Vision Trait has bad eyesight due to<br>a birth defect or later injury. The severity of this condition varies<br>with the Trait’s TP score; a –2 TP Poor Vision Trait represents<br>minor loss of visual acuity (including night blindness or color<br>blindness), while a –9 TP Poor Vision translates to total blindness<br>(in both eyes). The character with this Trait suff ers half its TP<br>score (rounded down) as a modifi er to any vision-based<br>Action Checks or personal combat Initiative rolls. For<br>example, a character with a –3 TP Poor Vision Trait suffers a<br>–2 roll modifi er (–3 ? 2 = –1.5, rounded down to –2) when<br>attempting to make out a target or object details, or roll<br>Initiative in personal combat.<br>Etc...See p.122
Property;PROPERTY [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +10 TP]<br>A character with the Property Trait holds land (or other real<br>estate) that provides a steady source of income. The amount<br>of land owned by the character depends on the Trait’s TP<br>score as indicated in the Property Trait Table below, which also<br>shows the annual income the property may generate for the<br>character (determined at the end of the year). Note that these<br>are averages only, and can vary wildly from faction to faction<br>and world to world. Any character with at least one level of<br>Wealth may possess a Property Trait up to a score of +5 TP.<br>Above that point, characters may only possess Property Traits<br>with a TP score equal to (or less than) their current Title Trait<br>level (if any).<br>Etc... See p.123
Rank;RANK [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +15 TP]<br>A character with the Rank Trait holds an official position in<br>a military, paramilitary, police or intelligence organization.<br>The TP score for this Trait indicates the level of authority the<br>rank carries, with ranks identifi ed by the letter “E” reflecting<br>enlisted ranks (E1, E2, E3 and so forth), and those noted by the<br>letter “O” refl ecting offi cer ranks (O1, O2, O3 and so forth). Officer<br>ranks may not be selected by characters that have not also taken<br>the Offi cer Skill Field.<br>Etc... See p.123
Reputation;REPUTATION [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Multiple [–5 to +5 TP]<br>A character with a Reputation Trait is famous (or infamous) for<br>some reason or other, and may be easily recognized far and wide<br>by admirers and enemies alike. The Reputation Trait Table loosely<br>defi nes the extent of a character’s Reputation, based on the Trait’s<br>TP score. Positive-TP Reputations refl ect fame and (generally)<br>admiration, while negative-TP Reputations refl ect stigmas, infamy<br>and outright hatred.
Sixth Sense;SIXTH SENSE [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive [+4 TP]<br>A character with the Sixth Sense Trait has a special intuition<br>that tends to off er inexplicable insight into unusual or<br>dangerous situations—a gut instinct that goes beyond reason.<br> Such characters receive a +3 roll modifi er to Perception Skill<br>Checks made to determine whether they are surprised, and<br>may also receive further “feelings” of imminent danger at the<br>gamemaster’s discretion.<br> A Sixth Sense feeling isn’t as accurate or well honed as<br>a radar blip, but is instead more of a general sense that<br>something is amiss. If a particularly deadly peril is looming, the<br>gamemaster may allow a character with Sixth Sense to make<br>a Perception Check, with a roll modifi er applied based on the<br>relative distance (in time or space) of the approaching danger.<br> A successful roll gives the Sixth Sense character a feeling that<br>“something’s not right,” while a roll with a signifi cant MoS may<br>impress the charater with a more accurate sense that the<br>enemy will attack soon (but with no solid idea of how many or<br>from where the assault might come).
Slow Learner;SLOW LEARNER [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–3 TP]<br>A character with the Slow Learner Trait has difficulty picking<br>up and improving Skills compared to other characters of<br>equal intelligence. Slow Learner increases the experience cost<br>for Skills by 10 percent during character generation (see p. 85)<br>and Skill advancement (see p. 333).<br> The Fast Learner Trait opposes the Slow Learner Trait. If a<br>character with Slow Learner receives or purchases Fast Learner<br>(or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Tech Empathy;TECH EMPATHY [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+3 TP]<br>A character with the Tech Empathy Trait has an intuitive<br>knack for gadgetry that goes beyond mere training. A<br>character with this Trait can grasp the concept of operating<br>technological systems faster than others, resulting in a 10<br>percent decrease to the XP costs for raising or purchasing any<br>Technician Skill. In addition, characters with this Trait receive<br>a +1 roll modifi er for using any equipment with a Tech Rating<br>of B or higher in non-combat situations (such as using the<br>Computers Skill or any Technician Skill when not in the midst<br>of raging crossfi re).<br> The Gremlins Trait opposes the Tech Empathy Trait. If a<br>character with Tech Empathy receives or purchases Gremlins<br>(or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Thick-Skinned;THICK-SKINNED [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+1 TP]<br>A character with the Thick-Skinned Trait is especially<br>resistant to the eff ects of extreme temperatures. A character<br>with this Trait who is exposed to extreme temperatures (see<br>Weather Conditions, p. 236) receives an additional 10 degrees<br>of tolerance to extreme temperatures over that of a normal<br>person (and an additional 5 degrees to the extremes of the<br>“comfort zone”). In addition, any modifiers for extreme<br>temperatures that apply are divided by 2 (rounding down).<br> If a BOD Attribute Check to resist extreme temperature fails, the<br>character suff ers damage equal to 1 point of Fatigue times half<br>the roll’s MoF (rounded up). If the character falls unconscious, he<br>suff ers 1 point of BOD Attribute reduction for every additional 20<br>minutes of exposure (rather than 10).<br> The Thin-Skinned Trait opposes the Thick-Skinned Trait. If a<br>character with Thick-Skinned receives or purchases Thin-Skinned<br>(or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Title;TITLE/BLOODNAME [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+3 to +10 TP]<br>Most Inner Sphere states acknowledge hereditary peerage<br>that places individuals in the ruling class by accident of birth<br>and breeding rather than merit. While openly disparaging this<br>“nobility,” the Clans also place great stock in the bloodlines of their<br>warrior caste, essentially establishing their own form of familial<br>politics based on ancestry traceable to the Clan founders. For the<br>Inner Sphere and Clans alike, these titles—or Bloodnames—form<br>the basis of power and infl uence that have dominated the Inner<br>Sphere and Clan homeworlds alike since time immemorial.<br>Etc... See p.126
Toughness;TOUGHNESS [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Opposed [+3 TP]<br>A character with the Toughness Trait is even less susceptible<br>to injury than his BOD Attribute may indicate. When sustaining<br>injury of any kind, a character with Toughness multiplies<br>any personal damage sustained by 0.75 (rounding up), and<br>multiplies any Fatigue suff ered from combat by 0.5 (rounding<br>normally, .5 rounds up).<br> The Glass Jaw Trait opposes the Toughness Trait. If a<br>character with Toughness receives or purchases Glass Jaw (or<br>vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
Thin-Skinned;THIN-SKINNED [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Thin-Skinned Trait is especially susceptible<br>to the eff ects of extreme temperatures. A character with this Trait<br>who is exposed to extreme temperatures (see Weather Conditions,<br>p. 236) loses 10 degrees of tolerance to extreme temperatures<br>compared to that of a normal person (and also loses 5 degrees<br>from the extremes of the “comfort zone”). In addition, any<br>modifi ers for extreme temperatures that apply are multiplied by<br>2. If a BOD Attribute Check to resist extreme temperature fails,<br>the character suff ers damage equal to 2 points of Fatigue times<br>the roll’s MoF (rounded up). If the character falls unconscious, he<br>suff ers 1 point of BOD Attribute reduction for every additional 5<br>minutes of exposure (rather than 10).<br> The Thick-Skinned Trait opposes the Thin-Skinned Trait. If a<br>character with Thin-Skinned receives or purchases Thick-Skinned<br>(or vice versa), the Traits cancel each other out.
TDS;TDS — TRANSIT DISORIENTATION SYNDROME [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative [–1 TP]<br>A character with Transit Disorientation Syndrome (TDS) <br>becomes violently ill after experiencing hyperspace<br>jumps—far more than is normal for most space-faring<br>people in the BattleTech universe. In game terms, the<br>character is treated as Stunned (see Personal Combat, p.<br>184) for a duration of 20 minutes after the jump (minus the<br>character’s BOD Attribute), and cannot “shake off ” these stun<br>eff ects until that much time has passed. For an additional<br>3D6 hours afterward, the character is nauseated, irritable<br>and disoriented, and suff ers a –1 roll modifier to all Action<br>Checks performed in this period.<br> If a character with TDS must endure a second hyperspace<br>jump while recovering from the fi rst, the character is knocked<br>out by the second jump for a period equal to the normal stun<br>duration (20 – BOD minutes), followed by another 24 + 4D6<br>hours of lingering nausea and disorientation that apply a –2<br>roll modifier to all Action Checks performed by the afflicted<br>character within that period.
Unattractive;UNATTRACTIVE [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative, Opposed [–1 TP]<br>A character with the Unattractive Trait is physically repulsive in<br>some way, be it from a deformity, scarring, an obnoxious voice,<br>or even terrible fashion sense. This ugliness makes the character<br>hard for others to stomach. Characters with this Trait receive a<br>–2 modifi er to Skill and Attribute rolls where the character’s CHA<br>Attribute is a factor. Unlike Attractiveness, this modifier applies<br>regardless of gender.<br> The Attractive Trait opposes the Unattractive Trait. If a character<br>with Unattractive receives or purchases Attractive (or vice versa),<br>the Traits cancel each other out unless the Unattractive Trait is<br>specifi cally assigned to one of the character’s aliases (in which<br>case, Unattractive is treated as an identity-dependent Trait; see<br>Alternate ID, p. 108).
Unlucky;UNLUCKY [CHARACTER]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Negative [–10 to –2 TP]<br>A character with the Unlucky Trait seems to have the universe<br>itself as an enemy, cursed with such bad karma that even the<br>most mundane tasks might go horribly awry without warning. In<br>game play, the gamemaster uses the character’s Unlucky Trait as<br>an EDG Trait against the unlucky character, either by forcing the<br>character to reroll an Action Check or modifying the result of an<br>Action Check roll by burning the character’s Unlucky Trait “points”<br>in the same way EDG points are burned (see Edge in Basic Game<br>Play, p. 42). The number of these “anti-EDG” points a character<br>has depends on the Trait’s TP score as shown in the Unlucky Trait<br>Table. These points regenerate every game session, unlike the<br>character’s own EDG, which may take longer to rebuild after use.<br> Gamemasters should be careful not to abuse this Trait, especially<br>when the outcome of a roll could mean the diff erence between life<br>and death for the character. Use of this Trait must also be restricted<br>to any rolls that aff ect the unlucky character directly, rather than<br>the fates of his teammates. Finally, if the unlucky character has<br>burned any of his own EDG at the same time the gamemaster<br>uses the Unlucky Trait against him, the unlucky character can<br>make a special Single Attribute Check against his EDG score. If<br>successful, the character instantly regenerates 1 point of EDG as<br>karma attempts to balance itself out.
Vehicle;VEHICLE LEVEL [VEHICLE]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Positive, Multiple [+1 to +12 TP]<br>A character with the Vehicle Trait begins play with an assigned<br>vehicle—a BattleMech, IndustrialMech, Combat Vehicle,<br>Conventional Fighter, Aerospace Fighter, Battlesuit or ProtoMech.<br>(Other vehicles, such as Support Vehicles, may be purchased<br>as equipment at the end of character creation; see Purchasing<br>Equipment, p. 91.) This Trait’s TP score indicates the weight class of<br>vehicle a character receives, as shown in the General Vehicle Trait<br>Table; with an increase of 2 TP, the character can also elect to own<br>the desired vehicle, to reflect a machine he previously purchased<br>outright (before spending C-bills in character creation) or received<br>as an heirloom. The vehicle ownership option is not available to<br>Clan characters who remain in the Clans, as all vehicles belong to<br>the character’s Clan and so can be assigned as the Clan sees fit.<br> The Vehicle Trait does not defi ne the exact model of a<br>character’s vehicle. For that, see the Custom Vehicle Trait (see<br>p. 112), or determine the model by using the Random Unit<br>Assignment Table (on pp. 130-135).<br> Vehicle Traits are identity-based and must be assigned to one<br>of the character’s aliases if the character has an Alternate ID (see<br>Alternate ID, p. 108). A character with multiple Vehicle Traits must<br>distribute them among all aliases as appropriate, but a given<br>identity can have any number of Vehicle Traits (of any value).
Wealth;WEALTH [CHARACTER (IDENTITY)]<br>Trait Type [TP Score]: Flexible, Multiple [–1 to +10 TP]<br> A character with the Wealth Trait begins play with more—or, in<br>some unfortunate cases, far less—than the 1,000 C-bills of starting<br>cash most characters receive to purchase personal equipment and<br>such at the end of character creation (see Purchasing Equipment,<br>p. 91). The Wealth Trait Table indicates how much starting cash<br>the character receives based on the TP score of this Trait, but does<br>not establish the equipment ratings the character may access, nor<br>does it establish any pay rates or extra income a character may<br>receive during game play. Any unspent money may be carried<br>over into general game play for later use.<br> Wealth Traits are identity-based and must be assigned to one<br>of the character’s aliases if the character has an Alternate ID (see<br>Alternate ID, p. 108). A character with multiple Wealth Traits must<br>distribute them among all aliases as appropriate, with a maximum<br>of one Wealth Trait (of any value) per identity.
